      PREFACE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the present volume an attempt has been made briefly to trace (the
      history of the picture poster from the earliest times!) and to comment
      upon and reproduce some of the most noteworthy examples in various
      countries. The English and American placards have received special
      attention, while the best examples of the French school have not been
      overlooked. With very few exceptions, only posters signed, or
      acknowledged, by the artists producing them, are included among the
      illustrations. The whole subject is treated from the point of view rather
      of art than of commerce. While it is believed that this book is the first
      which deals in English with the Pictorial Poster, the author desires to
      recognize his indebtedness to M. Maindron's work, and to the catalogues of
      M. Sagot and Mr. Bella. The last-named has rendered material aid by
      lending, for the purpose of reproduction, not a few examples contained in
      his collection.
    </p>
    <p>
      To name the artists and owners of valuable copyrights who have laid the
      author under obligations would, however carefully compiled, almost
      certainly contain serious omissions. It is hoped, therefore, that those
      whose names would figure in such a list will acquit him of intentional
      discourtesy or ingratitude. Special thanks are due to Mr. Gleeson White
      for his editorial work in connexion with this volume; indeed, whatever
      merits it may possess are due, in no small degree, to his care and
      assiduity. Although personally unknown to the writer, Mr. Spiel-mann has
      been so good as to assist materially in the matter of illustration. To the
      kindness of M. Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec is owing the frontispiece in the
      shape of a hitherto unpublished study for a poster; while the reproduction
      of a sketch for the "Phit-Eesi" placard was courteously consented to by
      Mr. Dudley Hardy, and Messrs. Vaterlow who printed the poster itself. The
      cover has been specially drawn by Mr. Charles Ffoulkes, to whom the writer
      desires to express his sincere thanks. The Artistic Supply Company
      (Limited) have been so good as to consent to the reproduction of
      unpublished copyright designs by Messrs. Bernard Partridge, Max Cowper,
      the Brothers Beggarstaff, Sydney Adamscm, Kerr Lawson, A. R. Wilson, and
      Lewis Baumer. A design, representing Sir Henry Irving as "Don Quixote" is
      illustrated here owing to the kindness of Miss Ellen Terry, who owns the
      original.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER I. THE STORY OF THE PICTORIAL POSTER
    </h2>
    <p>
      It would be merely foolish to pretend that the pictorial poster, looked at
      from the point of view of art, is of the same importance as a portrait by
      Velasquez or an etching by Rembrandt. Its aesthetic qualities have of
      necessity to be subordinated to its commercial qualities; the artist is
      the servant of the tradesman. His first business is not to achieve a
      decoration, but to call the attention of the man in the street to the
      merits of an article. He may be fantastic only in so far as his fantasy
      assists the advertisement; he must ever keep before his eyes the narrow
      object of his effort. The closest limits are set to his invention; it is
      not for him to do what he will, but rather to do what he must. Under such
      circumstances, it is, at the first blush, somewhat surprising that artists
      have condescended to the poster at all. The bounds of freedom in the cases
      of painting and of sculpture are, comparatively speaking, so wide that one
      is not unnaturally amazed that the artist of talent is willing to work
      within the strict limitations imposed on him in the production of a
      pictorial poster. And yet, after all, to the ingenious designer there is a
      certain fascination in the very strictness of these limits; the complexity
      of the problem allures him, and gives him the appetite for experiment.
      Moreover, if he believe that art is something more than a vague grace, a
      non-essential luxury, he is ever anxious to extend her domain, to make her
      empire universal. He believes it to be his mission to touch some ugly
      necessity, to inform it with art, and, in doing so, to adorn it. He is
      restless for new worlds to conquer, for fresh fields to occupy. His ideal
      is art everywhere, art in all. He would fain give style and grace even to
      the paraphernalia of commerce: the necessities of trade shall not be
      hideous if he can make them otherwise. And so it happens that he is
      willing, nay eager, to turn his attention to the poster, with the result
      that the hoarding becomes an interesting, even a charming, gallery of
      designs. What was one of the most hideous of human inventions is
      transformed into a delight to the eyes. Colour and interest are added to
      the street; the gay and joyous take the place of the dull and ugly.
    </p>
    <p>
      It follows, supposing that I have stated the case fairly, that it is not
      derogatory to the dignity, even of a very great artist, to apply his
      talent to the poster.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is clear that the poster is one of the oldest and most obvious forms of
      advertisement. It is almost impossible to conceive a time in the history
      of man, once he had learned to express his thoughts in design or in
      writing, when the idea of the thing did not exist. It must have been an
      incident of the most crude and ancient of civilizations; even the
      cave-dweller in the dim and distant past must surely have possessed the
      essential idea of it. From the cave-dweller to the comparatively complex
      civilization of the ancient and greater Egypt is a far cry. That the mural
      inscription, which is obviously the germ of the poster, flourished
      exceedingly in the Land of the Pharaohs is matter of history. A papyrus is
      comprised in the collections of the Louvre, which may fairly be described
      as a poster. It is dated so early as 146 b.c., and deals at length with
      the escape of two slaves from the city of Alexandria, offering a reward to
      anybody who should discover their place of retreat. Still more
      interesting, though less ancient, is an inscription in Greek, discovered
      in the Temple at Jerusalem, in 1872, by M. Clermont-Gannerau. It was
      issued during the reign of Herod the Great, and forbids the entry, by
      foreigners, to certain parts of the Temple on pain of death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the poster in Greece we know very little. Legal inscriptions were
      undoubtedly written on whitened walls, or on axones, the latter being
      wooden tablets painted white, and made to revolve slowly on an upright
      axis. In passing from Greece to Rome, we pass from somewhat fragmentary to
      comparatively exact: information. The Roman notice-board was called an <i>album</i>,
      and it is a matter of dispute whether it was white with black letters, or
      of a dark colour with the text in white. Anybody who took away, destroyed,
      or mutilated an album was liable to an <i>actio albi corrupti</i>, and to
      heavy damages besides. It appears to have been invented in the first
      place, in order to give publicity to the annual edict of the Prætor;
      subsequently, however, the word album was used to signify any tablet on
      which a public announcement was inscribed. The ruins of Pompeii have
      furnished us with at least one interesting fragment of an album, on which
      are written notices of the most diverse kinds. Amongst them are the
      following:
    </p>
    <h3>
      FAMILIA. GLADIATORIA VENATIO. ET. VELA.
    </h3>
    <p>
      and:
    </p>
    <h3>
      A. SVETTII. CERII.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      AEDILIS. FAMILIA. GLADIATORIA. PUGNAVIT. POMPEIS. PR. K. IVNIAS. <br />
      VENATIO. ET. VELA. ERUNT.
    </h3>
    <p>
      and again:
    </p>
    <h3>
      DEDICATIONS THERMARUM. MUNERIS.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      ENAI. ALLEI. NIGIDII.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      MAII. VENALIO. ATHELA.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      SPARSIONES. VELA.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      ERUNT. MAIO. PRINCIPI.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      COLON IÆ. FELICITER.
    </h3>
    <p>
      As for the Roman bookseller, he was in the habit of placarding his shop
      with the titles of books just published, or about to be published. Take,
      for instance, the shop described by Martial in the lines:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      " Contra Caesaris est forum taberna,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Scriptis postibus hinc et inde totis,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Omnes ut cito perlegas poetas.
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Illinc me pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The actor has never been inclined to hide his light under a bushel.
      Advertisement has always been dear to him, and it is not surprising to
      find that the Roman actor made the most of the opportunity of the
      publicity offered to him by the <i>album.</i> Not content with having his
      name inscribed in gigantic letters, he went a step further, and
      anticipated the illustrated <i>affiche</i>. Just as Sarah Bernhardt
      employs the decorative skill of Grasset to depict her as Joan of Arc, so
      did the old Roman actor employ Callades, an artist mentioned very
      favourably by Pliny, to portray him in his favourite parts. Callades would
      seem to have been the Chéret of his age: he was the great artistic
      advertiser of ancient Rome, just as Chéret is the great artistic
      advertiser of modern Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is obvious, then, that the idea of the illustrated poster existed among
      the Romans: the difference between Callades and Chéret is one of method
      rather than of vital principle. And even the difference in method is
      slight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the poster in the time which immediately succeeded the fall of the
      Roman Empire we have very little trustworthy information. It is possible
      that the Romans introduced the album into Gaul and into Britain, and that
      the sight of it became as familiar to the inhabitants of Eboracum and
      Uriconium as it was to the natives of Rome and Pompeii. A French historian
      of distinction has stated that the <i>affiche</i> was employed by the
      earliest of the kings of France, but this statement can hardly be said to
      be borne out by facts. It is at least certain that the signboard, which is
      a variation of the pictorial poster, was employed in the early part of the
      Middle Ages. The poster, unless illustrated, would have been useless in a
      community in which the art of writing was held effeminate, in which the
      most illustrious knight openly boasted of his inability to sign his name.
      The principal means of advertisement at that time was the public crier. As
      early as the twelfth century the criers of France formed an organized
      body, "for," as Mr. Sampson tells us in his <i>History of Advertising</i>,
      "by a charter of Louis VII. granted in the year 1141 to the inhabitants of
      the province of Berry, the old custom of the country was confirmed,
      according to which there were to be only twelve criers, five of whom
      should go about the taverns crying with their usual cry, and carrying with
      them samples of the wine they cried in order that people might taste. For
      the first time they blew the horn they were entitled to a penny, and the
      same for every time after, according to custom.... These wine-criers are
      mentioned by John de Garlando, a Norman writer, who was probably
      contemporary with William the Conqueror." The wine-crier is frequently
      mentioned in early French street-ballads. To instance one of them:
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      "Si crie l'on en plusors leurs
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Si bon vui fort a trente deux
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      A seize, a douze, a six, a huiet."
    </p>
    <p>
      In England also the crier was an early institution, for we find one Edmund
      le Criour mentioned in a document dated 1299. Even when the crier was the
      pre-eminent advertiser, the poster, or at least the handbill, had its
      place. At first the bills were written, but almost as soon as Caxton
      introduced the newly-discovered art of printing they were produced by that
      method. Perhaps the earliest English poster is that by which Caxton, about
      the year 1480, announced the "Pyes of Salisbury Use," at the Red Pole in
      the Almonry at Westminster. The size of this broadside is five inches by
      seven, and the text runs as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      "If it please any man spirituel or temporel to bye our pyes of two or thre
      comemo-racio's of Salisburi use, emprunted after the form of this prese't
      lettre, which ben wel and truly correct, late hym come to West-monster,
      into the almonestrye at the reed pole ane he shall have them good and
      chepe.
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      "Supplico stet cedula."
    </p>
    <p>
      The "pyes" in question, it may be noted, were a series of diocesan rules.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is in the sixteenth century that we meet with the poster properly so
      called. For example, we have a royal proclamation of François I relating
      to the police of the city of Paris, which runs: "Nous voulons que ces
      présentes ordonnances soient publiées tous les moys de l'an, par tous les
      quarrefours de cette ville de Paris et faux bourgs d'icelle, à son de
      trompe et cry public. Et néantmoins quelles soient attachées a un tableau,
      escriptes en parche-main et en grosse lettre, en tous les seize quartiers
      de ladite ville de Paris es esdiétz faux bourgs, et lieux les plus
      éminents et apparens d'iceulx, afin qu'elles soient cognues et entendues
      parfun chacun. Et qu'il ne soit loysible oster les dictz tableaux, sur
      peine de punition corporelle, dont les dictz commissaires auront la charge
      chacun en son quartier."
    </p>
    <p>
      The words "attachées a un tableau, escriptes en parchemain et en grosse
      lettre" leave no doubt that the poster as we now know it was a usual
      method of advertisement in the reign of François Ier. The <i>affiche</i>
      soon after received the attention of the French legislature, for the
      production and exhibition of posters of certain kinds in France, was
      expressly forbidden by "un arrêt du Parlement" dated the 7th of February,
      1652. To publishers and booksellers, however, the privilege of posting the
      titles of their new books was specially reserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      As printing became less expensive and methods for the mechanical
      reproduction of pictures and designs were discovered, it needed no great
      ingenuity to add emphasis to the poster by means of pictorial
      illustration. Acrobats, the stall-keepers at fairs on the ice, and the
      like, were speedily induced to adorn their advertisements with rude
      drawings, while Royal proclamations were usually decorated heraldically.
      Early in the eighteenth century, the bills announcing the departure and
      arrival of coaches were headed by pictures, as for example the one which
      related to the Birmingham coach in 1731.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even earlier in date, there are illustrated advertisements relating to the
      Roman Catholic church. One of these, produced in France, dated 1602, is
      very curious and elaborate in design. While, however, many posters such as
      this are profoundly interesting to the archaeologist, they can hardly be
      considered works of art. It is not until the middle of the present century
      is reached that we find important examples of pictorial poster
      deliberately planned by an artist. The modern artistic poster movement, as
      we shall see in the next chapter, had its origin in Paris some fifty years
      ago.

      CHAPTER II.&mdash;IN FRANCE DURING THE PRESENT CENTURY
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>s we have seen,
      the idea of the poster, and even of the pictorial poster, is an extremely
      ancient one, but it is only at the commencement of the present century
      that distinguished designers deliberately attempted to make the pictorial
      poster a work of art. The few posters, at once pictorial and artistic,
      which are of earlier date than the time in question, are artistic by
      accident rather than by deliberate intention. So early, however, as the
      year 1836, we find a really distinguished French artist, Lalance,
      producing a poster. Lalance was, perhaps, the pioneer of pioneers, and his
      advertisement for the book, "Comment Meurent Les Femmes," if not of great
      artistic interest, cannot be overlooked in any book dealing with the
      history of art as applied to the poster. Only a fewr copies exist.
      Immediately succeeding him, we have Célestin Nanteuil engaged in producing
      an advertisement for an edition of "Robert Macaire," dated 1837. The year
      following, Rafifet brought out his "Napoléon de Norvins." This work is
      signed as well as dated. Raffet, in addition to the "Napoléon de Norvins,"
      designed two more posters dealing with the career of the great emperor as
      well as the history of Algeria. Very soon after comes an important <i>affiche</i>,
      "Le Prado," by Eugène Gauché, and from that time the artistic poster
      became an established institution.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be fairly stated that the direct cause of the artistic poster in
      France was the illustrated book. The illustrated book, issued in weekly or
      monthly numbers, has always appealed keenly to the French, and it is usual
      to give the first number for nothing to all who care to ask for it. The
      illustrators of these books were very frequently induced by the publishers
      of them to do a poster advertising the edition of the works they had
      illustrated. Sometimes one of the illustrations in the book was merely
      enlarged and lithographed, but more generally the artist made a special
      design. Perhaps, at the time, the most widely known among French producers
      of the <i>affiche illustré</i> was Gavarni. The vogue for the works of
      this eminent illustrator and satirist is perhaps not so great as it was
      twenty years ago. At all events, the value of his works is not nearly so
      great as it was then, and it has become usual to talk of him in a manner
      which is patronizing rather than genuinely appreciative. It may be that

      even more general interest, is one done for an illustrated edition of "Don
      Quichotte," in which the very perfect, gentle knight is represented with a
      grotesqueness which would certainly have astonished Cervantes himself. Of
      a similar kind is the "Nains Célèbres," by E. de Beaumont. An illustrated
      poster of a kind utterly different to the one last discussed is by T. H.
      Frère. It was designed for the advertisement of a work entitled "La
      Touraine," by Stanislas Bellanger de Tours. Under no circumstances should
      one overlook an <i>affiche</i> of about the same period on account of the
      great personality of its designer. It is very generally admitted that the
      name of Edouard Manet is one of the greatest in the history of modern
      painting. It would indeed be difficult to over-estimate the extent of his
      influence on the pictorial art of the day. The poster reproduced in these
      pages is not unworthy his great talent. It is curious to notice that Manet
      and Fred. Walker, an English artist of about the same time, as to whose
      genius all are agreed, should have been at one in their endeavour to make
      the illustrated poster artistic as well as merely pictorial.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have not attempted to deal with any save the most prominent of the great
      number of French designers who took part in the poster movement during the
      fifties. Their names and the titles of some of their works will be found
      in the first catalogue of M. Ed. Sagot, and valuable criticism is
      contained in the pages of M. Maindron.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III.&mdash;IN FRANCE. THE WORK OF CHÉRET, GRASSET, AND
      TOULOUSE-LAUTREC
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>o many
      contemporary French artists are designing posters, that a single chapter
      dealing with them all would be of an alarming length. I have therefore, in
      the first place, separated from their fellows three who seem to me
      curiously individual and worthy of careful consideration. Of the men whose
      names head this chapter, pre-eminence is due, for various reasons, to
      Jules Chéret, whose position, in the matter of poster-designing, is quite
      without parallel.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be that men of rarer, of more fascinating, talent have now and
      again devoted themselves to the <i>affiche</i>; but none of them can
      compare with Chéret in the magnitude and curiosity of his achievement.
      Many have produced charming wall pictures: nobody, save Chéret, has made
      an emphatic mark on the aspect of a metropolis. Paris, without its
      Chérets, would be Paris without one of its most pronounced
      characteristics; Paris, moreover, with its gaiety of aspect materially
      diminished. The great masses of variegated colour formed by Chéret's
      posters greet one joyously as one passes every hoarding, smile at one from
      the walls of every café, arrest one before the windows of every kiosque.
      The merits of the Saxoléine lamp, the gaieties of the Moulin Rouge, the
      charms of Loie Fuller, the value of a particular brand of cough-lozenges,
      are insisted upon with a good-humoured vehemence of which Jules Chéret
      alone appears to know the secret. Others, in isolated cases, have possibly
      achieved more compelling decorations, but none can pretend to a success so
      uniform and so unequivocal. Few men as richly endowed with the gift of
      decoration would! have been content to produce work which, were it not for
      the portfolio of the collector, would be of an entirely ephemeral
      character. It must be irritating to the artist to watch the gradual
      destruction of his chefs-d'oeuvre, condemned as they are to be torn by
      every wind, soaked by every shower, blistered by the sun, blurred by the
      fog. It is natural that he should turn his eyes longingly to the
      comparative permanence of canvas, marble, or bronze; and it says much for
      Chéret's confidence in his artistic mission for his nice realization of
      his possibilities and limitations that he has remained faithful to the <i>affiche</i>
      for over twenty years. Now and

      again, it is true, he has turned aside to do work of more universally
      recognized and more pretentious a character, and the very fact that he has
      touched scarcely anything which he has not adorned, emphasises his
      fidelity to a branch of art until quite recently despised and held of
      little moment. It is, indeed, mainly owing to this devotion, to this
      lavish expense of talent, that the poster is not even now considered
      beneath the dignity of the collector. The judicious, as soon as their eyes
      fell upon Chéret's vast lithographs, decided that he was no mere
      colour-printer's hack, but an artist whose work would have to be reckoned
      with. There was something positively alluring in the spectacle of a man
      who calmly placed his gift at the disposal of the tradesman, who accepted
      without murmur the limitations which the tradesman imposed upon him. It is
      possible that, had it not been for the circumstances of his life, the
      streets of Paris would have remained undecorated, so far as Chéret was
      concerned, to this day. Commencing as the humblest of lithographers,
      Chéret did not take up art of set intention, but passed irresistibly,
      though it may be unconsciously, into it. After long years of patient and
      tedious work as an ordinary lithographer, at the dawn of the year 1866, he
      commenced what was destined to be the most notable series of pictorial
      posters in existence, a series containing over a thousand items, and one
      which happily has yet to close. It is doubtless the conditions of his
      early life, the lessons learned while under the yoke of trade, that have
      enabled Chéret to appreciate to the full that the first business of an
      advertisement is to advertise. Avoiding, therefore, all subtle harmonies,
      he goes in for contrasts of colour, violent, it is true, but victorious in
      their very violence. Blazing reds, hard blues, glowing yellows,
      uncompromising greens, are flung together, apparently haphazard, but in
      reality after the nicest calculation, with the result that the great
      pictures, when on the hoardings, insist positively on recognition. One
      might as well attempt to ignore a fall of golden rain, as to avoid
      stopping to look at them; they are so many riots of colour, triumphant in
      their certainty of fascinating and bewildering the passerby.
    </p>
    <p>
      As may be imagined, Chéret's skill has fullest scope when dealing with the
      lightest and gayest subjects: a <i>cascade de clowns</i>&mdash;to borrow a
      phrase of Huysman&mdash;an entrance of ballet girls; a joyous troupe of
      children, contented because toy-laden; these, and the like, are subjects
      most congenial to him. His style is essentially the outcome of the day. It
      possesses no decorative forerunners; it is not a thing derived; its
      parents are the gaieties of modern Paris. It is intensely actual, and in
      its actuality lies, it

      seems to me, its greatest claim to consideration. It is infused with a
      somewhat hectic gaiety which holds a not unimportant place in the lives of
      us suffering from this "sick disease of modern life." Of the sick disease
      itself, Chéret gives no hint. He is unflagging in his vivacity, unswerving
      in his insistence on the <i>joie de vivre</i>; instead of pondering over
      the inevitable sorrow of life, he busies himself depicting the naïve grace
      of the child, the elegance of the mondaine. His gifts lead him inevitably
      to such subjects. His merit as a draughtsman lies, in part, in vivacious
      rather than correct line: gaiety, as we have seen, is the chief quality of
      his colour: his composition is remarkable on account of the piquancy and
      appropriateness of its detail. He chooses with unerring fidelity the
      subjects suited to his temperament and his gifts. These subjects are not
      of infinite variety, and it follows that if one sees a great quantity of
      Chéret's work together, one becomes aware of a certain feeling of
      monotony. One can be satiated even of Chéret's gaiety and joyousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      To attempt any account of Chéret's thousand and more posters, is obviously
      impossible in any but an elaborate monograph devoted exclusively to him. I
      can do no more here than comment on a few of the most striking. It may be
      stated generally, that while the earlier ones are rarest because most
      difficult to procure, the more recent designs show the artist at his best.
      A mastery of chromo-lithography such as his, cannot be obtained without
      many essays, some of which are foredoomed to failure. In addition, Chéret
      has gradually improved alike in the splendour of his colour, and the
      disposal of his pattern. Perhaps he has never been happier in his
      treatment of children than in one or two of the "Buttes-Chaumont" series.
      The joy of the little ones in the possession of their new playthings is
      contagious. Utterly different in kind, though not less conspicuously
      successful, is "Les Coulisses de l'Opéra au Musée Grevin," a delightfully
      piquant representation of a group of premières danseuses in the
      traditional costume. As a specimen of amazingly effective and strangely
      beautiful colour, it would be difficult to exceed the "Loie Fuller"
      series; while, in the matter of pert gracefulness, Chéret has done nothing
      more delicious than the chic little lady in the yellow dress who smiles at
      you in the "Pantomimes Lumineuses." Anybody who could resist her
      fascinations would be a rival to St. Anthony. No collector of course, will
      overlook the great series of <i>affiches</i> which Chéret has contrived
      for the Folies Bergère, the Moulin Rouge, the Alcazar d'Eté, and similar
      places of amusement In order to sum up his talent as a designer of
      posters, Chéret has produced four decorative panels, which, although
      without lettering,

      are posters to all intents and purposes, and would take their places on a
      hoarding quite admirably. The subjects are most happily chosen; who,
      better than Chéret, could symbolize, in manner light and fantastic, music,
      comedy, pantomime, and dancing? The designs gain immensely, insomuch as
      they are not disfigured with a legend, for, in spite of the fact that the
      disposal of the lettering is of the very essence of a poster, Chéret, for
      some reason known only to himself, leaves that detail of his work to
      another designer, with results by no means uniformly fortunate. Before
      leaving Chéret, it is only just to him to point out that his work loses
      more than that of almost any other artist, in the process of reproduction
      in black and white. It is impossible to convey any idea of his amazing
      colour by means of a halftone block, and therefore, fewer reproductions of
      his designs are included in these pages than might be expected. Needless
      to say, he suffers greatly from more or less unskilful imitators. For this
      reason, combined with the fact that he is engaged on a series of

      To turn from Chéret to Eugène Grasset, is to turn to an artist in whose
      art career the poster is merely an incident. Grasset is a paragon of
      versatility; there are literally no bounds to his comprehensiveness.
      Besides being a painter of distinction, he has designed everything, from
      stained glass to book-covers, from piano-cases to menus. Unlike Chéret, he
      has been profoundly impressed by the work of old decorative designers; he
      has certainly not disdained to borrow; his borrowings, however, have been
      at once legitimate and intelligent. The Japanese, the old Italians, and in
      a less degree, the ancient Greeks, have been laid under contribution, with
      results which, if not amazingly original, are at least delightful. It
      would be idle to pretend that, from the standpoint of the advertiser,
      Grasset is the equal of Chéret. His sense of beauty, his passion for
      decoration, make it impossible for him to achieve the daring and
      victorious colour which is so effective in the work of Chéret. A panel of
      his posters, side by side with a panel of those of Chéret, is as a
      beautiful and somewhat quiet-hued wall-paper to a cascade of flowers of
      every conceivable colour. While, however, this is an important matter from
      the advertiser's point of view, it is of little moment to the collector,
      whose primary object is to fill his portfolios with things of beauty. At
      times, indeed, Grasset does achieve irresistible advertisement; nobody,
      for instance, could overlook the superb representation of Sarah Bernharct
      as "Jeanne d'Arc," standing with splendid disdain amidst a forest of
      spears

      fine decorative qualities. Of an entirely different kind is the delicious
      little poster which the artist did for an exhibition of his own work at
      the Salon des Cent in 1894; in the naïve simplicity of the thing, combined
      with its fine decorative quality, there is a hint of Botticelli and the
      old Italians. The contrast between this poster, slightly archaic as it is,
      and the realistic "Odéon Théâtre" is complete. The latter represents a
      charmingly graceful girl, in a delicious modern gown, watching a play. She
      is accompanied by a highly-proper looking matron, whose self-importance is
      enhanced by the possession of a handsome dress and a wealth of jewels.
      Very pretty, again, is the "Librairie Romantique," with the façade of
      Nôtre Dame in the background. Less worthy of Grasset is the "A la Place
      Clichy," which, in spite of the majestic old oriental who descants on the
      merits of an elaborate carpet to a critical European, is somewhat
      commonplace. Among the other productions of this artist, some of them
      excellent, but not calling for special description, are the "Histoire de
      France," "Napoléon," "Chocolat Mexicain," and "L'Encre Marquet," as well
      as those done to advertise a work on the capital cities of the world, and
      the exhibition of the productions of French decorative artists held in
      1893 at the Grafton Gallery. A bill designed for the South of France
      Railway Company is curious, insomuch as it is unlike the other productions
      of its designer. It consists of a series of pleasant little landscapes
      wreathed in the characteristic fruits and flowers of the Riviera. The

      that they are charming, though charming in manner entirely different;
      Lautrec's productions, alluring and powerful as they are, can by no
      stretch of the word be so described. He does not seek to attract you by
      joyousness of colour or grace of pattern, but rather to compel your
      attention by the force of his realism or the curiosity of his
      grotesqueness. For his posters are at once realistic and grotesque; they
      are delineations of life as seen by a man who, possessing the most acute
      powers of observation, is poignantly impressed by the incongruities of
      modern life, the physical peculiarities of modern men. He has some points
      of similarity with Hogarth, with Rowlandson; and the like, but his art is
      quite non-moral; he has no mission to depict vice as either hideous or
      ridiculous. His extraordinary "Reine de Joie," perhaps the most powerful,
      and certainly the least agreeable, of his posters, is a statement of fact
      rather than a criticism. This great bill, owing to the vehemence of the
      expression on the faces of the three people it represents, to the
      wonderful vigour of its line, to its extraordinarily effective, though
      simple, colour, is one of the most powerful designs of the kind ever
      accomplished. It may be doubted whether any book has been advertised in so
      unforgettable a manner as <i>La Reine de Joie</i>.

    <p>
      For the Paris <i>café chantant</i> artiste who possesses the charming name
      of Jane Avril, this designer has devised a grotesque decoration, which
      could not fail imperiously to call attention to her talents as a dancer.

      tulip. Once having seen this work, the name, and indeed something of the
      personality, of Jane Avril is impressed on one's mind. Moreover, one
      easily recalls this unassuming poster vividly, when works of art,
      consecrated by the admiration of generations of critics, are quite
      forgotten, or only faintly remembered. No man of more passionate and
      curious talent than Aristide Bruant has ever devoted himself to the
      business of light amusement, and it was no doubt quite congenial to
      Lautrec to advertise the performances which he gives in his cabaret.
      Again, the artist's picture of another entertainer, Caudieux, represented
      in the act of quitting the stage, is masterly for its indication of
      movement and its powerful characterization. Bad from the advertiser's
      point of view, but most interesting from that of the collector, is the
      extremely rare "Le Pendu," a production which for weird and intense
      tragedy compares to advantage with any of the artist's posters. Scarcely
      less rare, though by no means so important, is the <i>affiche</i> done to
      advertise the performances of La Goulue at the Moulin Rouge. A far more
      agreeable design is the "Divan Japonais," in which a fearful and wonderful
      girl, accompanied by a man as fashionable as he seems to be imbecile, is
      represented under the spell of Yvette Guilbert, whose tall, thin figure is
      seen across the orchestra, her arms, in the famous black gloves, being

      It is in no way astonishing that Mile. Guilbert has strongly attracted
      Lautrec, and that he has frequently made her the subject of his work. No
      music-hall performer has, so far, approached this brilliant woman in
      ability or in artistic prestige. Like Patti and Sarah Bernhardt, she is
      implored to testify to the merits of every brand of soap or every new
      perfume; like them her reputation extends beyond the bounds of her native
      place, and she is the admired of several foreign capitals. If the flower
      of French art and literature assemble to honour Zola, the proceedings are
      incomplete without a song from her; if the fastidious De Goncourt is
      presented with the rosette of the Legion of Honour, what more fitting than
      that she should deliver a recitation? In some degree she sees the life of
      modern Paris in the same light as Lautrec; her wonderful delineations are
      realistic as are his, though their realism is touched with a suspicion of
      the grotesque. Amongst other things, she has inspired Lautrec to a series
      of illustrations remarkable alike in drawing and colour; and he has not
      disdained to design lithographs to adorn the covers of different items of
      her <i>répertoire</i>. Owing to his kindness, I am enabled to reproduce,
      as the frontispiece to this volume, a sketch for a poster which he
      designed for her, but which, unfortunately, has never got beyond the
      experimental stage. It seems to me a specially interesting example of a
      remarkable talent applied to a very congenial subject. The posters of
      Lautrec are something more than works of art; they are human documents
      strangely eloquent of their moment. For this reason, their value may be
      more permanent than that of the productions either of Chéret or Grasset,
      delightfully fantastic as are the former, charmingly decorative as are the
      latter.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t is not for a
      moment to be pretended that the artists with whom this chapter deals are
      in any sense members of a single school: they have, indeed, many more
      points of difference than of similarity. I deal with them together,
      because, speaking roughly, their designs are saturated with the spirit of
      the day: their decorations are realistic, rather than fantastic or
      picturesque. They lean towards Lautrec, rather than towards Chéret or
      Grasset, but they are in no sense his imitators; some of them, indeed, are
      actually his predecessors.

    <p>
      Willette is an artist of such astonishing facility and variety, that he
      has, comparatively speaking, devoted little time to the <i>affiche</i>,
      and save in one or two conspicuous instances, he has failed to achieve
      compelling advertisements. And yet his artistic personality is so curious
      and so powerful that his posters are nearly all interesting to the
      collector,-more interesting to the collector, it may well be, than
      satisfactory to the advertiser. Willette is master of several manners. He
      can be realistic to the point of brutality, symbolical, graceful; while
      now and then he is almost austerely classical. There are, happily, few
      posters so impregnated with race hatred as the anti-Semitic bill intended
      to forward the artist's candidature at the <i>Elections législatives</i>
      of the 22nd of September, 1889. The design is ugly in the last degree, but
      it is, nevertheless, strangely powerful. Very different and very much more
      pleasing is the lithograph in black-admirably composed and executed&mdash;which
      advertised the successful pantomime, entitled L'Enfant Prodigue. The
      design is at once graceful and dramatic, and it is not surprising that a
      proof before letters is one of the gems of a collection of the posters of
      Willette. No more interesting souvenir of an experiment which fascinated
      both Paris and London can be conceived. Again, the bill advertising the
      International Exhibition of Commerce and Industry, held some time ago at
      the Champs de Mars (an unlettered proof of which commands no less than two
      pounds), is very desirable. The little bill in colours bearing the legend,

      is pretty, alike in colour and pattern, and has already become rare.

      Entirely appropriate to its purpose is the "Nouveau Cirque" advertisement,
      in which clowns, bare-back riders, and performing animals of all
      kinds-from a frog to an elephant-disport themselves with the utmost <i>abandon</i>.
      From this to the "Cacao Van Houten," is a far cry. From the point of view
      of the advertiser, Willette has done nothing better than his life-size
      study of a Dutch waitress in national costume. The thing is very
      decorative, and succeeds admirably in attracting attention: another and
      more complicated design for the same firm is only a shade less successful.
      This is entitled "La loi défendent le cacao contre le chocolat." The other
      posters of this artist include the rare "Petite National," the "Evénement
      Parisien" (which was, I believe, suppressed), the "Courrier Française,"
      the "Exposition Charlet," and the "Elysée Montmartre." The posters of
      Willette are marked by variety and ingenuity of invention, and there is
      little doubt that they will be of permanent value as revelations of a
      talent as individual as it is powerful.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the artistic poster is an unimportant incident in the career of
      Willette, it is still more so in that of Forain, whose essays in this
      direction have been few and far between. Forain is known to nearly every
      artist in Europe as a great master of black and white.
    </p>
    <p>
      Few, if any, can approach him in technical dexterity, few can express so
      much in so few lines. Moreover, to his technical mastery is added a
      searching power of criticism which gives to his work a further, and a most
      important, interest. In his desire to depict the truth, the whole truth,
      and nothing but the truth, he (no doubt unconsciously) becomes a moralist.
      He depicts life from no sentimental point of view; he can be realistic
      without seeming to appreciate the tragedy which is of the very essence of
      realism, so that on seeing one of his illustrations of modern life, one
      receives, apart from technical delight, a distinctly literary impression.
      Of his posters, perhaps the earliest is one unsigned and without
      lettering, representing an illuminated garden, in which a woman is
      depicted in the midst of an explosion of fireworks. Subsequent to this
      comes a bill to advertise one of the novels of Dubut de Laforest, which
      bears the artist's signature. The design which announces Forain's
      political drawings for the "Figaro" is of slight importance, as it was not
      originally intended for a poster. In spite of this it is by no means easy
      to meet with. Of greater interest is the "Exposition des Arts de la
      Femme." It was, however, only when Forain received a commission to produce
      an illustrated advertisement for a cycle show that he achieved a really
      memorable poster, a poster of real charm and rare

      originality. The sport of bicycling seems to have fascinated the <i>Parisienne</i>
      completely, and Forain has made a charming design, in which she is
      depicted in complete enjoyment of the fashionable pastime. The colour
      scheme is restrained and delicate, and the production, which exists in two
      sizes, should certainly be found amongst the treasures of every amateur of
      the <i>affiche</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The somewhat risky pages of the <i>Gil Bias Illustré</i> have for a
      considerable time been noticeable to artists, chiefly on account of a
      series of coloured illustrations by Steinlen. His relentless veracity in
      depicting the life of the lower classes of the Paris of to-day is almost
      without rival. No detail of squalor seems to escape him; without a tinge
      of remorse he proceeds to inform us of the meanest incidents in the
      tragedy of the poor or vicious quarters of the great city. By reason of a
      certain emphasis of colour and crudeness of design the art of Steinlen is
      admirably adapted to the production of such human documents. But it cannot
      be maintained that, whatever their technical merits, these studies of
      human misery are other than unpleasant-even painful. It is, therefore,
      altogether agreeable, when one turns to his essays in the art of the
      poster, to find his work graceful rather than tragic, urbane rather than
      mordant. Forsaking his mission of realistic illustration, he becomes gay,
      dainty, and fanciful as the best of his fellows. Even in a higher degree
      than the majority of them, he makes his design appropriate to the thing
      advertised. His decorations are spiced with a certain actuality, and, in
      being so, insist more effectively on the particular article the merits of
      which it is their business to proclaim. No better example of this could, I
      think, be put forward than the "Lait pur de la Vingeannestérilisé," a
      design which, in view of the material to be advertised, is conceived in
      the happiest vein. The pretty little girl drinking the milk, so much
      coveted of the cats which surround her, is less interesting than the
      animals themselves. The draughtsmanship of the latter is excellent, while
      there is a hint of that humanity of expression about the creatures which
      has produced for the work of Landseer so immense a popularity. Not less
      admirable, and of still greater interest, is the poster designed to
      advertise the performances of Yvette Guilbert at the Ambassadeurs. Amongst
      the numerous artists to whom the Sarah Bernharct of the music-halls has
      given commissions none has been more successful than Steinlen. The poster
      represents the singer behind the footlights in an attitude pre-eminently
      characteristic. The thing does not amount to a caricature, as does the
      hitherto unpublished delineation of Toulouse-Lautrec, but is merely a
      slightly exaggerated portrait. It is remarkably suggestive of a most
      alluring and delightful

      personality. As an advertisement, it must be confessed, it is not all that
      could be desired. The colour scheme, while very dainty, is not one which
      insists on its presence on the hoardings, so that the proximity of (for
      example) a Chéret renders it to some extent ineffective. At the same time,
      it is one of the most charming designs of the kind in existence, and no
      collector should fail to possess himself of a copy. It exists in three
      states: proofs before letters pulled in two tints only, ordinary proofs
      before letters, and prints after letters. In the former state it is
      rapidly increasing in value, but, insomuch as the lettering is of the
      essence of the design, the final state is the most desirable of all. To
      advertise an exhibition of his own work, Steinlen produced another study
      of cats, which is almost as agreeable as the "Lait pur." It is in two
      states: proofs before and after letters. The artist's design for the
      watering-place, Vernet-les-Bains, is not very important, but his early
      "Mothu et Doria," in three states, should not be overlooked. Earlier in
      date than any of the designs I have discussed is the "Trouville" and "Le
      Rêve." The latter is a pretty composition reproduced in
      chromotypo-gravure. While the posters of Steinlen are not so striking on
      the hoarding as those of some of his contemporaries, they are of the
      highest artistic interest, and will no doubt take a place second to none
      in the affections of many collectors. It is significant that already the
      rarest of them are by no means easy to procure.

      The art of Ibels is as little comprised in the poster as that of Steinlen.
      It is happily characteristic of young artists of the present day, both
      here and in France, that painting is not the only god of their aesthetic
      adoration:

      they experiment in many mediums, and it is really remarkable in how great
      a number of such experiments they succeed. What is generally true, is
      especially so of H. G. Ibels. Like Grasset, he has held an exhibition of
      his pictures at the Salon des Cent; he has made his mark in the galleries
      of the Champs de Mars; he has designed the covers of several pieces of
      music, and of a volume of poems by his brother, entitled "Chansons
      Colorées"; in addition, he is well-known as a book illustrator. His point
      of view is somewhat akin to that of Toulouse-Lautrec: he is passionately
      interested in his own moment, and depicts modern life with similar
      insistence on its ugly and grotesque aspects. And yet Ibels rarely fails
      to be decorative, and his style is the outcome of his own artistic
      personality, rather than the result of study of the work of other men. In
      his posters he has been conspicuously successful; so much so, that it is
      difficult to point to a single failure, though, it must be remembered,
      that as yet his productions have not been very numerous. It is possible

      that with some the "Mévisto à l'Horloge" will be deemed his best design,
      but it can in no sense be considered his most original. It represents the
      actor as Pierrot, and is graceful and pleasing rather than characteristic;
      indeed, one would almost think that in designing it the artist had been at
      pains to conceal his personality. Nor is the "Salon des Cent"-a charming
      and delicate little lithograph-in spite of the ingenuity and fantasy of
      its grouping of Pierrot, Harlequin and Columbine, the most noteworthy of
      Ibels' posters. We see him at his most original, in an advertisement for
      the illustrated paper entitled "l'Escar-mouche," to which he, together
      with Lautrec, Vuillard, Willette, and Anquetin, contributed drawings. It
      represents a café of the lower class, such as abounds in the workmen's
      quarter of Paris. The enormously fat <i>patron</i> enthroned behind the
      metal-topped bar, the waitress, cloth in hand, clad in her slovenly dress,
      the <i>ouvriers</i> in typical blue blouses, are studies in which accurate
      portraiture has been but slightly sacrificed to grotesqueness. The whole
      scene is admirably conceived, and the colour scheme, though very
      restrained, is certainly telling. Those who can do so should secure a
      proof before letters of this work, for the lettering is, I believe, not by
      the artist himself, and mars the effect of the design, although not in a
      very marked degree. Another interesting bill is that done for Mévisto's
      performances at the Scala music-hall; this is of great size and striking
      originality. But if grotesque force, and the power of reducing scenes of
      modern lower-class life into decoration, are Ibels' most pronounced
      characteristics, he can produce posters of the suavest charm. Amongst all
      the <i>affiches</i> I know, none seems to me more delightful than this
      artist's "Irène Henry." The <i>café chantant</i> singer whom it represents
      is justly a popular favourite with the Parisian public from the fact that
      she infuses into her performances no small amount of personality;
      moreover, her art is marked by grace and finish. Those who would see her
      as she appears to audiences at the Horloge, without going there, have only
      to look at Ibels' poster. With the rarest felicity, he has caught her
      physical individuality. She is represented in the act of singing in the
      open air to a crowd in the <i>café</i>, lighted by the familiar circle of
      white lamps. The line of the figure is most expressive: violet is the
      predominating colour. This poster is worthy a place in the French music
      hall series, which includes those designed by Lautrec for Jane Avril, by
      Steinlen for Yvette Guilbert, and by an artist whom I am about to
      consider, Anque-tin, for Marguerite Dufay.

      of them is worthy of the closest attention. The design for Marguerite
      Dufay is a piece of triumphant vulgarity. The subject is a very simple
      one; it is merely a woman of almost impossible fatness who performs at
      various Parisian music-halls on the trombone. Having stated this, one has,
      however, given no idea of the extraordinary qualities of this bill. It is
      safe to say that, once seen, it will never be forgotten; it should have
      made the fortune of the performer whom it advertises. The mirth of the
      thing is victorious and infectious; one seems almost to hear the coarse
      laugh; the ample body in the green dress seems to move as one stares at
      it. In line, in movement, this poster is, from a certain point of view, a
      veritable masterpiece. An advertisement which is, it seems to me,
      altogether more worthy of Anquetin's great talent is one designed for "Le
      Rire," a recently issued journal. It is an extremely fine lithograph in a
      single printing, and, as at present it can be procured for a few
      shillings, it should be in the possession, not only of those who care for
      posters as such, but also of all who are amateurs of the beautiful art of
      lithography. In the foreground is the figure of a huge man in mediaeval
      costume, which, while touched with the grotesque, is splendidly flamboyant
      At his side he carries a large portfolio, adorned with a grinning mask,
      while his hands, which are admirably drawn, point towards a crowd of
      grinning pigmies beneath him. Every one of the crowd is extremely
      expressive, and the effect of the whole production is enhanced by very
      excellent lettering. It would be difficult to meet with two <i>affiches</i>
      more interesting than the "Marguerite Dufay" and "Le Rire," and they place
      Anquetin amongst the masters of the art of the poster.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Anquetin is an artist of marked originality, so, in a manner totally
      different, is Pierre Bonnard. Save in the small number of his posters, he
      resembles Anquetin in hardly anything; on the other hand, his work has
      points of similarity with the later work of Lautrec. The posters of both
      these artists are decorative in a curious and somewhat similar sort of
      way, decorative in spite of their marked grotesqueness. Between the
      "Confetti" of Lautrec and the "Revue Blanche" of Bonnard there is a
      distinct decorative affinity. As both of them are dated the same year,
      1894, it is needless to suggest that either of these intensely personal
      artists has derived anything from the other; there is, indeed, no evidence
      whatsoever of imitation, or even influence. Of the two best-known posters
      of Bonnard, the "France Champagne" is the earlier in point of time, having
      been published in 1891. It is a lithograph in three colours, and
      represents an extraordinarily fantastic, and extremely <i>décolletée</i>
      girl, who holds in one hand a

      closed fan, and in the other an overflowing glass of champagne, which
      tumbles about her in a great cascade of foam. The background is yellow and
      the girl's dress red, while the upper part of the design is occupied by
      the arms of Paris and the text in large letters. The draughtsmanship is
      curious and vivacious, and the colouring conspicuously successful. This
      poster is not large, measuring as it does, only thirty-two by twenty-nine
      inches. The "Revue Blanche," though of nearly the same size, is much more
      complicated. In the foreground is a woman in huge hat and cape, which
      partly conceal her face, at whom an extraordinarily grotesque street
      urchin points his finger. The background is composed of innumerable
      advertisements of the <i>revue</i>, which a man in a great coat and silk
      hat, with his back to the spectator, is reading attentively. All the
      figures are in a sort of slate colour. The legend is admirably introduced
      into the foreground by means of huge white letters. Owing to the curiosity
      of its decoration, this specimen of Bonnard's work is a most desirable
      possession for the collector.

      theatre convulsed with laughter at what is taking place on the stage. The
      variety of expression on the faces of the spectators is infinite, and the
      effect of the whole thing is as mirthful as may be. From the advertiser's
      point of view, I can conceive nothing more completely satisfactory. It
      exists in colours and in black, and the latter is the rarer. The same
      artist's "Carte de Paris" would seem already to have become scarce. It is
      a large lithograph in one colour; an example was shown at the Poster
      Exhibition at the Royal Aquarium. There is also a large address card
      designed by Valloton for M. Sagot. While this is not actually a poster it
      almost amounts to one, and were it to be executed on a large scale, it
      would doubtless be most successful. It is to be hoped that Valloton,
      encouraged by his universally recognized success in the art of the poster,
      will not altogether give up its practice in favour of those other branches
      of art in which he is distinguished.

      The style of De Feure, if not so well adapted to poster work as that of
      some of his contemporaries, is nevertheless very interesting. His most
      characteristic effort is, perhaps, the "Salon des Cent, 5e Exposition."
      This design is very modern and very fantastic. It exists in three states&mdash;proofs
      before letters on vellum, proofs on Japanese paper, and ordinary prints.
      The proofs before letters command very good prices. Amongst the other
      posters of De Feure is that done for the performance of the singer, Edmée
      Lescaut, at the Casino de Paris; for the newspaper "Le Diablotin"; and for
      the "Paris Almanach." In addition, we must not overlook the pleasant
      little design for the contents bill of a special issue of "To-Day."

      The posters of Lucien Métivetare of very unequal merit. On the one hand
      the designs done by him for Eugénie Buffet, in her realistic <i>répertoire</i>
      of songs, are extremely distinguished. While, on the other, I could point
      to examples by this artist which are utterly unworthy his talent. Amongst
      Métivet's earlier works are "La Famille, journal hebdomadaire illustré,"
      and "L'Hygiène." A more recent bill advertises "Les Joyeuses commères de
      Paris," but Métivet's talent is seen at its best in the Eugénie Buffet
      advertisements, two studies worthy a place amongst the best posters which
      have come from the hands of contemporary French artists.

      Chéret and Choubrac, few artists have done so much poster work as
      Guillaume, and not many have maintained so high a level of accomplishment.
      Vigour, vivacity, and high spirits, rather than beautiful design and fine
      colour, are the characteristic qualities of posters by Guillaume. He is,
      it seems to me, seen at his best in the admirable "Extrait de Viande
      Armour," which is reproduced here. In its way, and looking to the thing to
      be advertised, nothing better has been done. The gigantic "strong man,"
      with his huge torso, colossal arms and legs, holding a tiny teacup in his
      immense hands, is not easily forgotten. The expression on the man's face
      is inimitable, and the accessories, such as cannons and dumbbells, are
      most appropriately chosen. The "Chapeaux l'elion" is a more complicated
      design, representing a crowd of men wearing hats of every conceivable
      shape. The colour of this design is very good, but its chief merit lies in
      the facial expression of the different members of the crowd. It would be
      impossible to conceive any single person in a hat other than the one he is
      wearing. In another excellent poster we are presented with a very <i>fin-de-siècle</i>
      young lady riding astride a stork which bears her rapidly through space.
      It would be hopeless to attempt anything like a complete list of
      Guillaume's posters, but among the most recent are the following, all of
      which deserve the attention of the collector: "Dentifrices du Dr. Bonn,"
      "Gigolette," "Old England," "Le Pôle Nord," "Cycles Vincent fils," "Le Vin
      d'Or" (in two sizes, unsigned), "Parfumerie Diaphane; le Diaphane Sarah
      Bernhardt," "L'ouvre de Rabelais par J. Gamier," and "Ducreux et Giralduc
      (Ambassadeurs)".

      bright and flippant posters can be seen any day on the London hoardings,
      and I have, therefore, purposely selected for reproduction two examples in
      his less usual manner. The "Lucile Wraim" is of an elegance to which
      Paleologue does not often attain, and would be distinguished in almost any
      collection of posters. "The Euskal Jai Parisien," besides being a good
      advertisement, is curious on account of its subject. Collectors who would
      possess a more typical example of Paleologue's work would be well advised
      to secure one or more of his music-hall series or his "Cabourg," an
      advertisement for the watering-place of that name. It is a large
      lithograph in five colours, and represents a very charming lady who, while
      bathing, is bent upon displaying her charms to the utmost. While
      Paleologue can in no sense be compared to Chéret in his gift of diffusing
      joyousness and gaiety, his work is undoubtedly "chic," and rarely fails in
      its first business of advertisement. Some of his posters have become
      difficult to procure, notably one designed for a Drury Lane pantomime some
      few years since.
    </p>
    <p>
      No artist, save Jules Chéret, has been more indefatigable in the making of
      posters than Choubrac. The list given in M. Maindron's book is a long one;
      that given in the catalogues of M. Sagot is still longer. The posters of
      Choubrac do not seem to have received so much attention at the hands of
      collectors as those of some of his better-known contemporaries. At the
      same time, not a few of them are interesting and rare. The bill done for
      the "Fin de Siècle" was suppressed, and, as a consequence, is in great
      demand. It exists in four states, three of which, in good condition,
      command no less than fifty francs. Merely to give the names of the
      music-halls and theatres for which Choubrac has worked would take up the
      better part of a page, while a list of the <i>artistes</i> whom he has
      advertised would be still longer. Amongst the most noticeable of his
      recent bills are the following: "Eldorado. Y'a pas d'erreur," "Folies
      Bergère. Armand Ary," "Folies Bergère. Programme," "Folies Dramatiques.
      Miss Robinson," "Moulin Rouge. Au Joyeux," "Neuilly-sur-Seine. Fête des
      fleurs," and "Gaieté. Rosa et Josepha" (in two states).

      An artist more unlike Choubrac than Maurice Boutet de Monvel it would be
      assuredly impossible to find, and the fact that these names are in
      juxtaposition must be taken as proof that no systematic arrangement has
      been attempted in this chapter. Boutet de Monvel is a painter of European
      reputation. His fame as an illustrator for, and a delineator of, children
      stands very high. His studies of child-life are unlike those of any other
      artist. They display the keenest observation and, as Mr. Pennell has
      rightly observed, one finds in them not a line without

      many a long day. Both of these are comparatively small. That which is
      earlier in date, "Petite Poucette," was originally designed as a cover for
      a piece of music, but, when reproduced on a larger scale, was found to be
      thoroughly effective as a poster. More dainty, if not more characteristic
      of the art of Boutet de Monvel, is the "Pâte Dentifrice du Dr. Pierre." In
      this design, one of the prettiest and most delightful little ladies in the
      whole Monvel gallery of pretty little ladies insists on the merit of the
      tooth-paste which, if it be half as good as she is charming, must be
      excellent indeed. Every artist knows his own business best, but one can
      only hope that, in what leisure he can snatch from his work in paint and
      illustration, Boutet de Monvel will place the collector of posters under
      new obligations to him. His note as a decorator of the hoardings is as
      distinct as it is agreeable.

      A very interesting figure in modern design is undoubtedly Carloz Schwæbe.
      One of the leading lights of that curious institution the "Salon Rose +
      Croix," it would indeed be curious if Schwæbe did anything commonplace.
      His posters are as remarkable as those other productions with which he has
      delighted some and puzzled not a few. Mystic, slightly archaic, they are
      the work of a man of poetical temperament who has chosen the graphic arts
      instead of literature as his means of expression. The two posters from his
      hand are very decorative in their strange way, and contain passages of
      great beauty. In the

      kneeling woman is remarkably impressive, while the irises amidst which she
      kneels are beautifully drawn. The lettering of this poster is most
      original, and the designer has evidently taken great pains with it. It is
      a lithograph in two colours, and measures forty-two and a half by
      thirty-one and a half inches. Schwæbe's larger poster, the "Salon Rose +
      Croix," is in one colour only, and is a good example of his work. So far
      this curiously-gifted artist has confined himself to advertising a concert
      and a picture show; it is not to be expected that he will ever condescend
      to soap or extract of beef. Another of the Rose + Croix men, Aman-Jean,
      has done a poster for the Salon which rivals in curiosity the productions
      of Schwæbe himself.

      A little advertisement which had, it may well be, some influence on the
      poster movement in England, was that by which André Sinet advertised an
      exhibition of his own works held at the Goupil Gallery in 1893. This was
      an attractive little bit of design of which the colour was very agreeable.
      In addition to it, Sinet has done the inevitable poster for Yvette
      Guilbert. Another painter of talent who has made an advertisement for an
      exhibition of his own work is H. Guérard. It represents a group of ravens
      and is in poker work. It would appear to be rare, as it is quoted in none
      of the catalogues. A copy, exhibited at the Aquarium in 1894, is in the
      collection of Mr. Ernest Hart. Still another artist who

      has, I believe, done only one poster, is Goissaud. His design was to
      advertise the "Société des miniaturistes et enlumineurs de France," and is
      a lithograph in one colour. Among the Salon des Cent series we have,
      besides the admirable posters of Grasset and Ibels already alluded to, a
      very grotesque and effective little design by Jossot. It represents an
      amazing old gentleman of weird aspect, in cocked hat, paying his franc for
      admission to the exhibition. Of its kind it is effective enough. Another,
      by Cazoly, with a curious portrait of Paul Verlaine is reproduced here.

      It is certainly with no view to hurt the feelings of those artists whose
      names do not head this chapter that they are represented by a mere <i>et
      cetera</i>. It must be understood that one of the least polite of
      contractions, in this case, involves no discourtesy whatsoever.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, I may instance such able work as Grün's "Le Carillon: cabaret
      artistique." Few posters are more vivid or more actual than this. The
      price of it is a matter of pence, and it should certainly not be neglected
      by those whom it amuses to collect the <i>affiche illustré</i>. Grün, in
      addition to "Le Carillon," has produced "Poléon-Revue: Décadent's
      Concert," and in addition a design for an insurance company. One of the
      most charming of the more recent French posters is one by H. Gray, dealing
      with "La Prétentaine," a play produced some time ago at the Nouveau
      Théâtre. In addition he has advertised "La Bonita" at the Cirque d'Eté,
      "Les Mousquetaires," at the same place, "Les Saltimbanques" at the Cirque
      d'Hiver, and the <i>bal masqué</i> at the Théâtre de l'Opéra. The last is
      perhaps the best known of his <i>affiches</i>. Among others, Bac has done
      a poster for Yvette Guilbert at the Horloge, which is signed and dated
      1892. The bicycling craze has called into existence a perfect torrent of
      posters, and Bac, together with Gray, Guillaume, Lunel, and Paleologue,
      have produced posters of more or less interest. A gentleman who is
      sufficiently modest not to state his name, did a design which called forth
      the wrath of the authorities. Whereupon an artist called Lepur designed an
      <i>affiche</i> bearing the significant legend, of which this is a
      translation: "Grand choice of vine-leaves (fig-leaves) of all sizes for
      posters, as demanded by the virtuous journals, the 'T(emps '), the
      'G(aulois '), and the 'D(ébats ')."

    <p>
      The following is a list, with the names of typical examples of their work,
      of some other French artists of distinction who have designed posters:

      dans le désert," "Folies Bergère: Vue de la salle," "Petit national: Le

      It will have been noticed already how great apart the music-hall and the
      <i>café chantant</i> play in the history of the pictorial poster. Yvette
      Guilbert has been the cause of a baker's dozen of <i>affiches</i>; Anna
      Thibaud (that charming singer of the songs of Béranger); Anna Held, with
      her curious manner, and still more curious appearance; Irène Henri, of
      intense personality; Jane Avril, and May Belfort; to say nothing of
      Aristide Bruant, of Caudieux, of Paulus, and the rest of the school who
      have made the music-hall stage of France a matter of no small importance

      without a certain pathos. It is true that we remember, through the gossip
      of their friends, Garrick and Mrs. Siddons, Talma and Rachel, but even
      these are uncertain phantoms lingering in the haze of memory. Only
      yesterday they were intensely actual, to-day they are not more real than
      Burbage and Betterton. After all, the history of the actor's art is not
      without its immortals. Macaulay's schoolboy could doubtless have related
      the compliment of Dr. Johnson to Mrs. Siddons: the latest escapade of the
      great Sarah is the joy of the paragrapher. The music-hall, however, has
      still no artist in any country (save, perhaps, the unforgettable Yvette)
      who has much chance of permanent remembrance. But when the toil and moil
      of existence is ended, when the singer has sung his last song, it may
      chance that he will be remembered because some collector of such
      unconsidered trifles as picture posters has placed in his portfolio a work
      of Chéret or of Lautrec.

      To turn from the music-halls to the great railway companies is an emphatic
      transition, and yet the former, no less than the latter have done much to
      encourage the artist to apply his talent to the <i>affiche</i>. The Great
      Western Railway Company have illustrated at their stations and in their
      carriages, by means of photography, all that is romantic and interesting
      in the country through which their line runs. And, again, the great lines
      of the United States have brought into vogue vast systems of pictorial
      advertisement. Their opportunity was undoubtedly a magnificent one. For

      matter they had some of those vast natural developments which appeal to
      mere man as absolutely terrific. The waterfall, splashing itself into
      luminous dust, the immense and silent mountains, the lakes which are seas,
      the vasty canons which occur in different parts of the States, inevitably
      appeal to the imagination. It is therefore not wonderful that the great
      lines of America have preferred literal and exact illustration to
      fantastic delineation. The railways of France, on the other hand, have
      employed to no inconsiderable extent the artist to figure the beauties of
      the places at which they have stations. Amongst the most important French
      designers who have worked at the railway <i>affiche</i> are:-Fraipont

      CHAPTER VI.&mdash;IN ENGLAND: FROM FRED WALKER TO DUDLEY HARDY
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hile the pictorial
      poster undoubtedly existed in England previous to the production of Fred
      Walker's "Woman in White," its artistic qualities were conspicuous by
      their absence. No body of artists who designed posters, such as that of
      which Ga-varni was one in France, is to be met with in the history of
      English art until the present day. While, as Mr. Spielmann reminds us in a
      recent magazine article, Mr. Godfroy Durand and Mr. Walter Crane had both
      attempted the artistic <i>affiche</i> previous to Walker, the efforts of
      neither made a pronounced impression, nor were they productive of
      permanent results. The work of the first of these three artists announced
      the appearance of the then newly-founded "Graphic," and that of Mr. Walter
      Crane proclaimed the merits of a brand of lead pencils. It is interesting,
      as an example of Mr. Crane's immense versatility in decorative design,
      that he should be among the pioneers of the poster movement in this
      country. That his early effort was overshadowed by Walker's very imposing
      work is not a matter of surprise. From the first, Walker appears to have
      been deeply impressed by the possibilities of the hoardings as a free art
      gallery. To use his own words, as quoted by Mr. Spielmann: "I am impressed
      on doing all I can with a first attempt at what I consider might develop
      into a most important branch of art." How Walker's view has been realized
      the mere existence of this book is sufficient to prove. This design, which
      was done to advertise Wilkie Collins's novel, "The Woman in White,"
      represents a magnificently-draped female figure stepping through a door
      out into the night. With one hand she opens the door, with the other she
      imposes silence on some person unseen. This was cut on wood by W. H.
      Hooper, who also engraved the small block we are permitted to reproduce
      here from "The Magazine of Art." The design is in black and white, and has
      the limitations from the advertising point of view of black and white
      work; but, apart from this, it is in every way a work which could not fail
      to impress the passer-by. "The Woman in White" is, unfortunately, Walker's
      sole essay in the art of the poster; on the other hand, Mr. Walter Crane
      has produced a series which, we may hope, has yet to close. It would seem
      that over ten years elapsed between his first and second attempts in the
      art of the poster. We meet with him for the second time in a design in
      blue and yellow

      which advertised the Covent Garden Promenade Concerts given in 1880. This
      has become extremely rare, and the artist himself does not, I believe,
      possess a copy. Following the Covent Garden bill was one announcing the
      performances in London of the Paris Hippodrome Troupe. This is merely an
      enlargement on a vast scale of a classical drawing intended to adorn a
      book describing the show, but it is distinctly interesting, more so, it
      seems to me, than the pretty little coloured thing-a window-bill, rather
      than a poster-which advertises Hau's champagnes. Other posters by Mr.
      Crane deal with an exhibition of his own works, with various insurance
      companies, with the "English Illustrated Magazine" (an enlarged version of
      the cover), and the exhibitions of the Arts and Crafts Society. It will be
      seen that Mr. Crane's contribution to the art of the poster is a very
      substantial one, and if his designs do not always fulfil the sweet uses of
      advertisement, they are generally marked by fine taste. It is a matter of
      common knowledge that Professor Herkomer has left hardly any art or craft
      untouched, and it therefore goes without saying that he has left some of
      them unadorned. To succeed as painter, etcher, carver, musician, poet and
      playwright, lecturer, and actor is not given to mere man. Professor
      Herkomer's posters cannot, I think, be considered among his more fortunate
      performances. That done for "The Magazine of Art" does not lack a certain
      feeling for composition: the weird

      creature who told us that "Black and White" was coming seemed to me to
      lack both dignity and grace, and, moreover, to possess very few
      compensating qualities. Amongst other posters by Professor Herkomer is one
      for his own exhibition, and one for an exhibition of pictures recently
      held at Oxford.

    <p>
      It should be noted that while most of the mural decorations of Mr. Crane
      and Professor Herkomer are, strictly speaking, posters, in that they were
      designed for the hoardings and for the hoardings alone, a great many
      designs and pictures by eminent artists have been reproduced and posted
      contrary to the original intention of their designers. The most prominent
      of these is, of course, Sir John Millais' famous "Bubbles," on the
      reproduction of which enormous sums have been spent. The thing is pretty
      enough, but cannot compete as an advertisement with a really good poster
      properly so called. Of course the name of Sir John Millais was one to
      conjure with, and the success of the thing has been, doubtless, great. But
      it is not an experiment one cares to see frequently repeated. Messrs.
      Pears were more happily inspired in the commission which they gave to Mr.
      Stacy Marks to produce a <i>bona fide</i> poster. His "Monks Shaving,"
      seems to be most excellently conceived, and, indeed, to be the most
      interesting of Messrs. Pears

      gallery of illustrated advertisements. Art has certainly played a very
      prominent part in the battle of the soaps. Mr. G. D. Leslie used his gifts
      to insist on the merits of the Sunlight brand, while Mr. Burton Barber
      pleaded pictorially for the Lifebuoy brand. A curious bit of poster-making
      was the reproduction of a random sketch of a girl sitting on a champagne
      cork, by Mr. Linley Sambourne, which seems to meet us at every turning.
      Again, Mr. Harry Furniss's man who had used Pears' soap years back, "and
      since then had used no other," is an enlarged reproduction used for
      advertising purposes of a drawing in "Punch." On the other hand, the
      "Minerva," which Mr. Poynter designed for the Guardian Assurance Company,
      was actually devised for the purpose of a mural advertisement. It cannot
      be strictly called a poster, insomuch as it is never seen in the open air
      unless glazed. It is a classical design in several colours, and is of a
      very elaborate character. For the purpose of exhibition indoors, it is
      glazed and mounted on linen with rollers. Another contemporary English
      painter who has received very high official recognition and has done a
      poster is Sir James Linton, P.R.I. His subject was assuredly an attractive
      one, "Antony and Cleopatra," but it can hardly be maintained that, for an
      artist of so great repute, he has produced an especially memorable design.
      It is a lithograph in one colour, and measures fifty by fifty-two inches.
      Its date is 1874, so it is clear that Sir James Linton is among the little
      band who tried to do something for the pictorial poster in

    <p>
      England when it was held of no account. Mr. Charles Green, a member of the
      institution of which Sir James is president, produced a rather ingenious

      ago in Mosley Street. It

      It will be observed that the artistic poster was in the air in England not
      very long after it began to develop in France. It does not, however, seem
      to have taken so great a hold on English artists or on the English public
      as on the artists and public of France. In England the artistic poster
      appears to have been received coldly or with indifference, and doubtless
      many designers who would have been glad to turn their attention to the
      poster were deterred therefrom by lack of public sympathy. But all this
      has happily been changed, and if the number of poster designers is to
      continue increasing at the present rate, the difficulty will be, not to
      find the artistic advertiser, but to find the thing to be advertised. A
      crowd of clever young men, actuated by the success which met the efforts
      of the designers dealt with in the next chapter, have rushed to the poster
      with results altogether important.

      CHAPTER VII.&mdash;IN ENGLAND: THE WORK OF DUDLEY HARDY, AUBREY BEARDSLEY
    </h2>
    <h3>
      AND MAURICE GREIFFENHAGEN
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he English artists
      of established reputation with whom I dealt in the last chapter, were, as
      we saw, so anxious to inform their posters with aesthetic qualities, that
      for the most part, they overlooked the obvious fact that their work was
      vain unless it really fulfilled its primary purpose of advertising. It was
      left for the three men (all of comparatively recent reputation) whose
      names head this chapter, to give the right direction; to insist that not
      art, but advertisement, was the first essential. It is not for an instant
      to be pretended that their achievement equals in importance that of the
      three designers discussed in a corresponding chapter in the section of
      this book devoted to France. Quantity of production, it is true, is a
      small matter in art; and yet, in so far as quantity of production entails
      experience, one is forced to take it into consideration. The success of a
      man who has produced a hundred posters, or more, is scarcely to be
      expected of a designer, however ingenious, who is only making his first
      attempt. Moreover, to an artist accustomed to work on a small scale, it is
      a matter of extreme difficulty to appreciate, and when in the throes of
      production to keep in mind, the essentials of a design intended to be seen
      at a considerable distance, in the open air. He is apt to be tempted into
      pretty detail or subtle and harmonious colour, and therefore to forget
      that he should be simple almost to the point of crudeness. Under these
      circumstances, it is not less remarkable than it is encouraging, that Mr.
      Hardy, Mr. Beardsley, and Mr. Greiffenhagen in their earliest essays
      apprehended the situation at once, and produced posters which inevitably
      caught the eye of the beholder and created an impression which remained
      with him for a considerable time. Differing in all else, the first designs
      of these three artists were alike, in that they were admirable
      advertisements. From every hoarding in London, from the walls of every
      station on the Underground Railway, one was vehemently called upon to
      purchase a new weekly, or a new series of an old one, or to visit the
      Avenue Theatre. If the call was resisted, it was assuredly no fault of
      these artist-advertisers. To suggest that what they have done would have
      been impossible,

      or at least improbable, if France had not paved the way, is scarcely to
      discount their immediate and unequivocal success: even the greatest artist
      is unwise if he does not condescend to make use of the work of the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is, I think, Mr. Dudley Hardy who, of the three artists named, owes
      most to France. He has made a variation, a very personal and alluring
      variation, be it said, of a theme essentially Gallic in its unrestrained
      gaiety, its reckless joyousness. There is something of Chéret, and there
      is even more of Jan Van Beers, in the end-of-the-century girl, elegant as
      she is impudent, whom Mr. Hardy depiéts with such amazing verve and
      abandon. She is too light-hearted, too irresponsible, to be a daughter of
      this land of grey and rainy skies; she takes nothing seriously, save
      perchance a detail of her costume. And yet she is stamped with Mr. Hardy's
      personality as thoroughly as are the charming <i>Parisiennes</i> of Chéret
      with the individuality of their inventor. Mr. Hardy began, and began
      wisely, by trusting for his effect to a single bold figure. Elaborate
      composition implies detail, and detail is one of the pitfalls of the
      designer of posters. Take, for example, the vast sheets which were
      employed to advertise one of the spectacles at Olympia. The overcrowding
      of small figures and closely-realized views either produced no impression
      whatsoever on the spectator, or at the most an impression due entirely to
      the immensity of the sheets. Mr. Hardy's series of posters commenced most
      auspiciously with that audacious young lady in a yellow dress, saucy hat,
      and flying black boa, who, not deigning to entreat, compelled the
      passer-by to rush to the nearest bookstall for a copy of Mr. Jerome's
      weekly "To-Day." Later, in similar vein, came the dashing girl in red,
      used by the manager of the Prince of Wales's Theatre to insist on the
      merits of "A Gaiety Girl." It may be doubted whether any more effective
      mural advertisement has ever been seen in London than that formed by
      half-a-dozen copies of this poster, arranged in the manner of a frieze in
      front of the theatre during the run of the piece. If the idea was that of
      the bill-sticker, the man was a genius of his kind: I cannot help
      suspecting, however, that the striking arrangement was due to Mr. Hardy
      himself. Or perhaps it was the happy thought of an outsider. In addition
      to the large "Gaiety Girl" poster, the two smaller bills which this artist
      designed to advertise the same play, full as they were of dash and go,
      must not be overlooked. To the collector they have a merit which he will
      not fail to appreciate. They are of manageable size, and this is more than
      can be said of most of Mr. Hardy's productions. It must not be thought,
      however, that

      Mr. Hardy can do no more than repeat with slight variety of detail the <i>chic</i>
      girl to whom he first introduced us; already, notwithstanding the
      comparatively small number of his designs, he has shown a very commendable
      versatility. The proprietors of "St. Paul's," in the days when that
      journal regaled its readers on the portraits, not of dancing girls, but of
      right reverend prelates, commissioned Mr. Hardy for a large design
      appropriate to the semi-ecclesiastical character of their journal. The
      choice, in view of the "Yellow Girl," was a somewhat curious one; but the
      experiment justified itself. The artist rose to the occasion; on the
      hoardings of London there appeared a woman of austere, even saintly,
      demeanour, clad in sombre robes, and armed with a spike of the Madonna
      lily. In spite of the low scheme of colour, the design was very telling as
      an advertisement. It has become very rare; indeed, notwithstanding the
      fad; that the dealers quote it at various prices in their catalogues, it
      may be questioned whether it is to be procured at all. When the policy of
      "St. Paul's" was changed&mdash;when it stepped down from its shrine to
      join the multitude and be of the world, worldly&mdash;the art of Mr. Hardy
      was once more called in to introduce the paper in its new guise. For the
      first time, so far as I know, he attempted composition. His idea was a
      happy one. The poster represented a young lady, evidently light-hearted
      and of unquestionably fantastic costume, see-sawing on a quarter of the
      moon with a gentleman of slight intellect, but exceedingly smart clothes.
      Seen under certain conditions the composition is distinctly effective, but
      from a long distance it fails to assert itself as do Mr. Hardy's simpler
      designs. In his most recent effort he has returned to the single figure,
      and he has done nothing more striking than his bill for "The Chieftain,"
      at the Savoy Theatre, which represents a man in picturesque costume on a
      red ground. The lettering of nearly all Mr. Hardy's posters is admirable.
      It is invented by the artist himself, and forms an essential part of the
      design. For the rest, it should be remembered that the poster is a mere
      incident in Mr. Hardy's art career. As an illustrator he is with us
      everywhere; as a painter he is held in deserved esteem. It is to be hoped,
      for the sake of the artistic poster in England, that he will continue to
      devote some of his time to a branch of art in which, in comparatively a
      short time, he has so greatly succeeded.

      The art of Mr. Aubrey Beardsley has been so enthusiastically received, on
      the one hand, as a new revelation, and so passionately condemned, on the
      other, as the mere glorification of a hideous and putrescent aspect of
      modern life, that it is difficult to consider his work with calmness. One
      thing, however, is certain: an impression

      of some kind, whether agreeable or the reverse, it has undoubtedly left
      upon all who have seen it. It cannot be dismissed by stating that it is
      derivative rather than original; that to a large extent it is the outcome
      of Japan, and in a less degree of the old English school of caricaturists.
      Whether it be good or bad, the extraordinary impression it has made cannot
      be gainsaid. It is probable that the work of no young designer of recent
      times has called forth so much homage of imitation, so great an amount of
      that kind of caricature which is among the sincerest forms of flattery.
      Mr. Beardsley's eccentricities are so pronounced, that to parody his work
      was simply to do the obvious. From "Punch," august by reason of its fifty
      years of tradition, to the poorest comic rag produced to catch the
      errand-boy's spare halfpenny, is a far cry; and yet the former, no less
      than the latter, has treated its readers to a series of pictorial
      Beardsleyisms. It would have been wonderful, indeed, if Mr. Beardsley, who
      is nothing if not modern, had not attempted the artistic poster. His
      opportunity came when the Avenue Theatre was taken by an enthusiastic and
      courageous young actress for the production of plays by living English
      writers, which, whatever their fate from the commercial point of view,
      were at least to possess definite merits as pieces of literature. In order
      to advertise Dr. Todhunter's "Comedy of Sighs," and Mr. G. Bernard Shaw's
      "Arms and the Man," Mr. Beardsley excelled himself, and designed perhaps
      the most remarkable poster ever seen, up to that time, in London.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing so compelling, so irresistible, had ever been posted on the
      hoardings of the metropolis before. Some gazed at it with awe, as if it
      were the final achievement of modern art; others jeered at it as a
      palpable piece of buffoonery: everybody, however, from the labourer
      hurrying in the dim light of the morning to his work, to the prosperous
      stockbroker on his way to the "House," was forced to stop and look at it.
      Hence, it fulfilled its primary purpose to admiration; it was a most
      excellent advertisement. The old theatrical poster represented, in glaring
      colours, the hero in a supreme moment of exaltation, or the heroine in the
      depths of despair. Mr. Beardsley did not condescend to illustrate, but
      produced a design, irrelevant and tantalizing to the average man, though
      doubtless full of significance to himself. In many respects the Avenue
      bill must be considered the best poster which so far has come from this
      artist's hands. The very graceful figure on a small poster for "The Yellow
      Book" speaks for itself. It is more vivid, more curious, than either of
      the two done for a London publisher. Most collectors, however, will
      treasure even more highly

      the charming design done by Mr. Beardsley to advertise the Pseudonym
      series of short stories. In it we meet with the artist in his less mordant
      mood. The sketch of the old bookshop in the background is quite
      delightful, and the whole design is less grotesque than most of Mr.
      Beardsley's productions. The arrangement in purple and white, which he did
      for the same firm, is a very striking performance in his later manner. Its
      importance as a poster is, however, seriously discounted by the fact that
      the design has nothing whatsoever to do with the text, which has been
      added in a manner almost inconceivably clumsy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The success of Mr. Beardsley in the production of artistic posters has
      encouraged a host of imitators, so that it is quite within the bounds of
      possibility that he will found something in the nature of a school.
      Already, on the other side of the Atlantic, more than one artist has been
      inspired by him. The posters of Mr. Bradley, for example, with which I
      shall deal later, are unquestionably adaptations, at once skilful and
      intelligent, of Mr. Beardsley's decorative manner. Again, to return to
      England, the pleasant arrangement in red and white, designed by Mrs.
      Dearmer to advertise a recital recently given by her in London, proves
      that she has been affected by the simplicity and directness which are so
      conspicuous among the merits of Mr. Beardsley in his essays in the art of
      the hoarding. Of his many parodists only one, I think, has actually
      attempted the poster. The essay in question was made by Mr. J. Hearn,
      under the signature of "Weirdsly Daubery," and the result was very
      fantastic and amusing. The design was done for some amateur theatricals at
      Oxford, and it was curious to

      incongruity, in every nook and corner of "the sweet city of the dreaming
      spires."

    <p>
      The case of Mr. Maurice Grieffenhagen is similar to that of Mr. Dudley
      Hardy, insomuch as both have been well known for some time to the public
      as painters and as the producers of very accomplished work in black and
      white. At present Mr. Grieffenhagen, as a designer of posters, can only be
      judged by a single production. It may be said at once that nothing more
      distinguished, nothing which is less imitative or derivative, has come
      from English hands than Mr. Grieffenhagen's advertisement for the "Pall
      Mall Budget." Admirable alike in colour and in pattern, the poster is
      entirely appropriate to its purpose of keeping before the eyes of the
      public a publication which escaped frivolity on the one hand and dulness
      on the other. All who watch the development of the artistic poster in
      England with interest, cannot but hope that the "Pall Mall Budget" poster
      will be the first of a series by the same artist equally delightful and
      original.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is interesting to note that while we are still a long way behind the
      French in the matter of the artistic poster, the productions of the three
      artists with whom I have just dealt have received a cordial welcome at the
      hands of Parisian collectors. In the dealers' shops you may see Mr.
      Hardy's "Gaiety Girl" side by side with Lautrec's "Reine de Joie," while
      Mr. Grieffenhagen's young lady in red looks with demure surprise at the
      antics of her more frivolous sisters, as depicted by Jules Chéret. There
      is, again, a steady demand for anything by Mr. Beardsley, who, it would
      seem, has already become an established favourite with French
      connoisseurs. As we shall see in another chapter, the prices put in Paris
      upon English posters compare very favourably with those at which the works
      of the ablest French designers are valued. In matters of art, few cities
      are more insular and intolerant than the French metropolis; and those
      English artists who are devoting themselves to the poster, should be
      encouraged by enthusiastic recognition where enthusiasm was least to be
      expected.

      CHAPTER VIII.&mdash;THE WORK OF OTHER CONTEMPORARY ENGLISH DESIGNERS

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>ince this book was
      commenced as the companion, rather than the rival, of that of M. Maindron,
      English designers of the poster have multiplied in a degree altogether
      phenomenal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up to the time in question, as we have already seen, the English artist
      who attempted the poster was exceptional. The famine, which was prevalent
      only a year or two ago, has become the abundance of today, so that where
      one expected a dearth of subject matter, one has in fact an excess. It
      seems to me that, apart from the English pioneers, whom we have already
      considered, the brothers Beggarstaff, in reality Messrs. Pryde and
      Simpson, two young artists, are entitled to the first place among the
      makers of the English artistic poster. They have best appreciated the
      essence of their business: less than almost any native designers, they are
      innocent of any homage of imitation. They have imitated neither Chéret nor
      Lautrec: it may well be that they have had the wisdom to take a hint here
      and there from both of these masters of the art of the <i>affiche</i>. As
      yet the hoardings of London are screaming with the vulgar designs of the
      advertiser's hack. The admirable art of the Beggarstaffs is, up to now,
      infrequently met with. Their curious advertisement for Sir Henry Irving's
      production of "Becket," was eclipsed by that done for the same manager's
      "Don Quixote," while the latter has to give place to one intended to
      announce a special issue of "Harper's Magazine." All of these force
      themselves on the collector's attention. They are at once striking and
      artistic; they cry their wares well, and they are a delight to the eyes.
      The lettering in the Harper poster is beyond all praise. Of its kind, it
      is the most beautiful English lettering of which I know. At the Aquarium
      Exhibition the Beggarstaff's showed four posters which advertised Nobody's
      Blue, Nobody's Candles, Nobody's Niggers, and Nobody's Pianos. If each
      "Nobody" is not rapidly converted into "Somebody," the various
      manufacturers and proprietors of the articles mentioned above must be very
      stupid people. All were excellent; that which advertised Nobody's Pianos
      was a most curious and à most original performance. It seems to me that
      the Beggarstaffs have few serious rivals in England, and not very many in
      France. Their works should help very

      It will be remembered that when Mr. Sickert took it into his head to
      depict the Sisters Lloyd in their music-hall habit, the critics fell out
      greatly. Even the young ladies in question had, it is said, scant
      affection for a design in which everything was suggested and nothing
      declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had, it is true, the recompense of advertisement, and that, to a
      music-hall singer, is a very sweet recompense. It was characteristic of
      Mr. Sickert that he should go to the music-halls for a subject. The "New

      Wilson Steer are amongst those of his colleagues who have done the same
      thing. Mr. Sickert's poster, which is, I believe, as yet unpublished, is
      in four colours. It is calculated to make a good advertisement, and one
      can only hope soon to meet with it on the hoardings. As an impressionist
      painter of talent, Mr. Wilson Steer is as well known as Mr. Sickert. A
      "New English Art Club" Exhibition without his work would be one which
      lacked a most characteristic feature. Mr. Steer gave us an opportunity of
      appreciating his talent as a painter by organizing a show of his own work.
      To advertise this he did a poster, which was excellent of its kind, and is
      in consequence very rare. It is a comparatively small lithograph in four
      colours, and is quite unlike this artist's other work. It leans, it seems
      to me, towards Pre-Raphaelitism rather than towards Impressionism. An
      artist who has certainly sat at the feet of Mr. Whistler is Mr. Mortimer
      Menpes. To advertise several exhibitions of his paintings, he has invented
      at least three posters, which certainly do not lack the merit of
      originality. He has abstained from the frivolous girl and grotesque man.
      The "France," the "Venice," and the "India" are in their way considerable
      achievements in dainty design and quiet and harmonious colour. Mr. Menpes,
      by being intentionally simple, has arrived at notable conspicuity. All
      this artist's designs are of small size, and are appropriate rather to the
      notice board than to the hoarding. Nothing more opposite to the fastidious
      productions of Mr. Menpes could be conceived than the vigorous poster by
      Mr. Lockhart Bogle advertising a Scottish Athletic Gathering, held in
      1892. This is a large lithograph, consisting of a single figure of a
      Highlander, which, if not remarkably beautiful, is drawn with vigour and
      with no small accuracy. Mr. Brangwyn is one of those English painters of
      whom we are entitled to be proud. His directness, the audacity of his
      impressionism, the splendour (if sometimes ill-considered) of his colour
      schemes, cannot be passed over even by those who have slight sympathy with
      his method. That, if so inclined, he would produce a poster at once
      startling and artistic is not to be denied. The one which he has already
      designed to advertise an exhibition of South African pictures by himself
      and Mr. William Hunt, held at the Japanese Gallery, is certainly by no
      means worthy his remarkable talent, and one trusts that he will cease for
      a moment from painting pictures and produce a poster which shall be
      memorable in the history of the <i>affiche</i> in England.

      clever painting. In this exhibition his pictures ranged from a large study
      of Mr. Clive as "Hamlet" to slight but beautiful studies of Venice under
      various atmospheric conditions. In his poster work, of which at present
      little has been seen, Mr. Richards shows that, to some extent, he is under
      the influence of Mr. Dudley Hardy. Mr. Richards, no less than Mr. Hardy,
      is undeniably up to date, and his work is really effective. Among the most
      recent additions to the ranks of our popular illustrators is Mr. Lewis
      Baumer. One meets with his work everywhere; in "To-Day" and in the
      shortlived "Unicorn." His bills to advertise the Academy students' annual
      burlesque are pretty, if they are nothing else. Mr. Baumer has certainly
      still to make his mark as a poster designer. The Artistic Supply Company,
      who are paying special attention to the pictorial poster, have already
      produced a dainty little <i>affiche</i> by him. It may be noted here that
      the company in question have arranged with some of the most eminent
      English designers for the reproduction of artistic posters, and that
      several, which illustrate these pages, do so only on account of their
      permission most generously given.

      Raven-Hill. From almost the first, his connexion with the journal in
      question has been a very intimate one. Hardly a number is without a
      specimen of his powerful drawing and his gift of comic invention. While
      suggesting, in the best sense, the style of the incomparable Charles
      Keene, Mr. Raven-Hill's work in black and white is the outcome of his own
      personality. It would have been strange if this very modern artist had not
      produced pictorial posters: his talent was perfectly adapted to his doing
      so with success. His small bills for "Pick-Me-Up" are vigorous in drawing,
      bold in colour, and of a pleasant fantasy. They only measure twenty by
      thirty inches, but they are very telling. A complete set of them is a most
      desirable addition to the collector's portfolio. Another accomplished
      member of the staff of "Pick-Me-Up," Mr. Edgar Wilson, has designed a bill
      for the recently defunct journal, "The Unicorn." It is effective, but to
      me personally, the colour scheme is even more crude than the exigencies of
      a poster demand. Mr. Reginald Cleaver, whose sketches of scenes in the
      House of Commons created so favourable an impression in "The Daily
      Graphic," has not yet, I believe, deliberately produced a pictorial
      poster; but one of his drawings, reproduced on a large scale, lends itself
      well enough to the purposes of mural advertisement. Mr. Sydney Adamson,
      the art editor of
    </p>
    <p>
      "To-day" and "The Idler," has done a bill which, when it is seen, will be
      Jield, I have small doubt, a very striking performance. It is happily
      conceived and boldly executed, and should make a striking patch of colour
      on the hoardings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Merely to chronicle the names of the innumerable Wilsons who are producing
      pictures would take quite a considerable space. It may be noted in passing
      that, like Edgar of that name, Mr. W. Wilson has also attempted an <i>affiche</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among others who have designed posters which have yet to be seen an the
      hoardings are Mr. Max Cowper, Mr. A. R. Miller, Mr. Kerr Lawson, Mr. F. H.
      Townsend, whose black and white work one meets everywhere, Mr. Roche, a
      prominent member of the Glasgow School, and one of the greatest living
      English artists, Mr. Phil May.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Phil May is not the only "Punch" man who has been seized with the
      prevailing mania for the production of posters. His colleague, Mr. Bernard
      Partridge, has already designed one which is reproduced in these pages.
      One associates Mr. Partridge with dainty and idyllic work rather than with
      work which is vigorous, but his first essay in the poster seems to me to
      be very promising. Mr. J. T. Manuel's work is as unlike that of Mr.
      Bernard Partridge as possible. His pictures might be by a clever member of
      the young French School who

      have taken more than a hint from Forain. The designs for posters which Mr.
      Manuel exhibited at the Westminster Aquarium, if not so distinctive of his
      talent as his contributions in black and white to "Pick-Me-Up," were not
      without definite merit. Of the three, that catalogued as "A Music-hall
      Singer" struck me as the best. It should be purchased by Miss Minnie
      Cunningham, for the likeness between her, and the young lady it
      represents, if accidental, is marvellous. Among young decorative painters
      of the day who are not mere imitators of such masters as Sir Edward
      Burne-Jones or Puvis de Chavannes, but have invented a style for
      themselves, must be included Mr. Charles Ffoulkes. The two examples of his
      poster-work here reproduced are as beautiful in colour as they are refined
      in pattern. Moreover, they proclaim themselves in loud tones. Their tones,
      however, are those of a silver trumpet rather than those of cymbal or of
      gong. At times Mr. Ffoulkes forsakes his lofty imaginings and depicts <i>chic</i>
      young ladies quite in the best French manner. Mr. L. Solon's poster,
      reproduced here, is a very characteristic example of his decorative style.
      In inventing it, the artist has clearly kept before him the fact that a
      poster cannot live by beauty alone; if, happily, there be beauty, there
      must of necessity be advertisement, else is failure inevitable.

      Very unlike Mr. Solon's poster are the <i>affiches</i> of Mr. Heywood
      Sumner; those which I reproduce here seem to me to be very characteristic
      of his graceful gift of design. Mr. Morrow is already an established
      favourite on the hoardings of London, and justly so in that his

      works should certainly be collected.

    <p>
      Of Mr. R. Anning Bell it is not too much to say that for versatility only
      Mr. Walter Crane among English artists can be said to rival him, and, what
      is far more important, his success in a medley of mediums is not to be
      gainsaid. His poster for the Liverpool School of Art, over which he
      presides, is a magnificent piece of decoration, and nothing so fine, in
      its way, has ever been, seen on English hoardings. It takes one up to the
      Elgin marbles; it is an oasis of the classical in a desert of the new. I
      can only mention the following native artists, not previously considered,
      who have produced pictorial posters of interest: Mr. F. Barnard
      ("Everybody should read in the European School"), Mr. F. Simpson ("Land of
      the Midnight Sun," "To Norway Fjords"), Mr. Robert Fowler, R.I., whose
      poster for the Walker Art Gallery is here illustrated, Mr. Sidney Haward
      (p. 279), Mr. Skipworth ("An Artist's Model"), Mr. Skinner ("Pall Mall
      Magazine"), Mr. Starr Wood and Mr. A. G. Draper.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have already remarked that the poster movement in this country amounts
      to a positive revolution. No young artist is satisfied unless he has a
      hand in the decoration of the hoardings; the gold frame is for the time
      forgotten, and all have their eyes on the lithographer's stone. France has
      undoubtedly had a long start of us, but if she is to retain her supremacy
      she must look to her laurels. Our young men are beating at her doors,
      though beating only in a spirit of friendly rivalry. Happily, between
      England and France there is, at this moment, only one war-the war of the
      pictorial poster.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>n the sweet uses
      of advertisement the American is surely an expert, and it would have been
      curious indeed, if he had overlooked so obvious and so effective a method
      of advertising as the pictorial poster. Finding, in the notorious phrase
      of Mr. Whistler, that "Art was on the town," the American advertiser was
      one of the most eager of those passing gallants who chucked her under the
      chin. Who it was originated the artistic poster movement in the States, it
      were hard to say with certainty: it may have been Mr. Matt. Morgan. Among
      recent American poster producers, three, however, are most conspicuous,
      Mr. Edward Penfield, Mr. Louis J. Rhead, and Mr. Will. H. Bradley. It is
      probable that the first-named was the innovator: at least, one would be
      tempted to judge so from the quantity of his designs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Penfield is still young, having been born at Brooklyn in the year
      1866, so that if he was the first American artist to deal with the poster,
      the movement in that continent is obviously a recent one. Most of his
      posters are on a small scale, and partake of the nature of window-bills
      rather than of placards especially destined to the hoarding. At the same
      time, Mr. Penfield has been by no means slow to appreciate that it is the
      first

      business of an advertisement to advertise, and his appreciation of this
      fad, coupled with a very dainty fancy and no small technical skill, has
      led to results which are of unquestionable importance. With his earliest
      efforts I cannot pretend to be well acquainted. In 1893 he produced for a
      firm at Salem a large bill which measures eighty-one by forty-two inches.
      The subject is a girl in a black dress and yellow jacket who is laden with
      packages. For the publications of the firm of Harpers, Mr. Penfield has
      done quite a quantity of excellent and artistic advertisements. Amongst
      the most effective is one produced for a special midsummer number of
      "Harper's Bazar," representing a girl playing a banjo, divided by a
      crimson sun from an attentive listener of the opposite sex. Again, for the
      issue of July, 1894, the artist gives us a girl in white lighting red
      crackers arranged to spell the name of the month. For the February number
      of the following year, we are presented, most appropriately, with a
      gentleman posting a valentine in an orange coloured letter-box. In April
      of the same year, Mr. Penfield gives us Joan of Arc in yellow, wielding
      sword and staff. Amongst the numerous books which Mr. Penfield has
      advertised may be mentioned "The Cloister and the Hearth," "Pastime
      Stories," "Our English Cousins," and "Perlycross." This artist's work is
      always ingeniously conceived, and the colour schemes are not seldom
      pleasantly audacious. Mr. Penfield gives us very agreeable versions of the
      American girl in general, and of the "summer girl" in particular. His
      maidens are adorably conscious of their power to charm, and are fully
      alive to the fact that their gowns are of the smartest.
    </p>
    <p>
      To turn from Mr. Penfield to Mr. Louis J. Rhead is to turn to an artist
      settled in the United States, but English by birth and education. Mr.
      Rhead was born at Etruria, that unclassical place with the classical name,
      and comes of a family of artists. He was, I believe, a student at South

    <p>
      Mr. Rhead seems to have taken to the poster with the greatest enthusiasm,
      and he has undoubtedly produced a series of curious and striking designs.
      By far the most important of his efforts, though not the largest, are the
      designs which he has done for the New York "Sun." In one of these very
      daring productions, a crimson sun glows in a golden sky. The ground is
      green, the footpath and the trees are blue, while the girl's costume is
      garnet and red. It must be confessed that this colour scheme sounds
      somewhat formidable, but Mr. Rhead has invented an arrangement at once
      artistic and compelling. The lettering, it must be noted with regret, is
      not from his own hand. One of the largest of Mr. Rhead's posters is the
      "Pearline," in which a girl in a green and red dress is represented in the
      act of pinning a sheet on to a line. This design measures forty-one by
      twenty-eight inches. Of considerable size, and of no small merit, is the
      poster executed for the "Century," Christmas, 1894, the chief feature of
      which is a girl with a peacock. Among other effective designs which stand
      to the credit of Mr. Rhead may be mentioned those advertising "Harper's
      Bazar," Christmas, 1890, Thanksgiving, 1894, and Christmas of the same
      year. For the "Century," besides that already noticed, he has done several
      interesting posters, and he helped to advertise various numbers of "St.
      Nicholas" last year. It is to be noted that

      Mr. Louis Rhead has held an exhibition of his posters, the catalogue of
      which, by reason of its very characteristic and personal decorations, is
      highly esteemed by collectors of those unconsidered trifles which end in
      becoming especially dear to the connoisseur.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the magazines of the world, the "Chap Book," which emanates from
      Chicago, is by no means the least interesting. Fascinating as is the
      title, the contents of this little periodical are still more so; its
      editors seem to have eschewed banality, and to have gone in for novelty,
      even when the new did not possess an extraordinary degree of merit. It
      were meet that so original a publication should have an advertiser of
      corresponding eccentricity. In Mr. Will. H. Bradley, the proprietors of
      the "Chap Book" undoubtedly possess such an one. Born at Springfield,
      Massachusetts, Mr. Bradley lives in Chicago, and to that town and its
      publications he has mainly devoted his energies as an artist advertiser.
      It will hardly be disputed that he has seen and assimilated, in no small
      degree, the manner of Mr. Aubrey Beardsley. He is, however, a great deal
      more than a mere imitator; what he has borrowed, he has borrowed with
      conspicuous intelligence, and nobody could for a moment accuse him of
      anything approaching petty larceny. Among his most important posters is a
      colossal one which, in the manner of Mr. Beardsley, proclaims the
      attractions of the drama by Mr. Henry Arthur Jones, entitled "The
      Masqueraders." In 1894 Mr. Bradley advertised the "Chap Book" by means of
      two dancers in red and brown costumes; the following year he insisted on
      the same publication by means of a girl in white and a man in black; and
      yet again, through the medium of a young lady in blue, mixed up with trees
      in intense purple, outlined with red and white; and several other equally
      effective compositions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bradley is, however, not the only artist intimately connected with
      Chicago who has distinguished himself in the production of posters. A
      native of that city, Mr. Will. Carqueville, has done very interesting work
      for the firm of Lippincott's. In the year 1894, at least one design by him
      was commissioned, and in the succeeding year he produced four or more.
      That he is not afraid of colour is proved by the fact that in the poster
      done for Lippincott's, March, 1895, he combines dark purple, yellow, blue,
      and bronze. In another design we meet with red, purple, yellow, and blue.
      Mr. Kenyon Cox is an American artist whose fame is by no means confined to
      the United States. A pupil of Gerôme and Carolus Duran, he has, so far as
      I know, made only one essay in the art of the poster. This measures
      eighty-one by forty inches, and is in black and white. It represents a
      male figure carrying a torch, and is an advertisement for "Scribner's
      Magazine." Mr. Scotson Clark was a schoolfellow of Mr. Aubrey Beardsley.
      He has, among other posters, done two to which the picturesque labels of
      "Our Lady of the Peacock Feather," and "Lady of the Iris," are attached.
      In addition, for the March issue of the "Bookman," 1895, Mr. Scotson Clark
      drew a monk, with book in hand. Mr. George Wharton Edwards, the well-known
      painter in water-colours, must be credited with three designs for the
      "Century," in the months of February, March, and April, 1895. Moreover, by
      means of a drawing of a girl and a peacock, he proclaimed the
      twenty-eighth annual exhibition of the American Water-Colour Society, in
      addition to designing a bill for a book entitled "The Man Who Married the
      Moon." The advertising enterprise of the firm of Scribner has made
      poster-collectors the richer by one or two productions by Mr. Charles
      Gibson Dana. He it was who announced, with no inconsiderable skill, the
      issues of "Scribner's Magazine" for the months of January and February,
      1895. Mr. Archie Gunn is the son of a well-known drawing master in one of
      the large towns of the Midlands. Leaving England for America, he found an
      outlet for his talent as a draughtsman on the New York journal "Truth."
      His work is nearly always vivacious, even where it is not particularly
      original. His posters were done for the "Illustrated American," and are by
      no means bad examples of his craftsmanship. Like most prominent American
      artists, Mr. Thomas Burford Meteyard studied in Paris. His poster to
      advertise a book called

      "Songs from Vagabondia" is in black and white, and consists of portraits
      of the artist himself and the authors of the book, Mr. Bliss Carman and
      Mr. Richard Hovey. A limited number of copies were printed "sur Japon,"
      and these, I believe, are rare. As in the case of so many other American
      artists, Mr. Francis Day's poster work was done for the most part for the
      great illustrated magazines which do such credit to the United States, as
      an art-producing nation. Mr. Day's design for "St. Nicholas," Christmas,
      1894, seems to me altogether agreeable, while in the series designed for
      "Scribner's Magazine," more than one interesting thing will be found.

      In dealing with the poster in England, we have noticed the fact that one
      woman, Mrs. Dearmer, has succeeded in producing a bill at once artistic
      and effective. Miss Ethel Reed would seem to be the most conspicuous
      lady-artist who has taken up the designing of artistic posters in the
      States. Her efforts date only from last February, when she did an
      advertisement for the "Boston Sunday Herald." Since then she has produced
      several designs which are held in considerable esteem by American
      collectors. Amongst other artists who have taken part in the poster
      movement on the other side of the Atlantic are the following: Messrs.
      Alder ("New York World," March 17th, 1895), Allen, Palmer Cox ("New
      Brownie Book"), C. Miles Gardner ("Boston Sunday Herald," February 10th,
      1895, and March 10th, 1895), Oliver Herford, Charles M. Howard ("Boston
      Sunday Herald," April 21st, 1895), Frank King ("New York World," April
      7th, 1895), H. McCarter (the Green Tree Library), Moores ("St. Nicholas,"
      November, 1894), Julius A. Schweinfurth (Boston Festival Orchestra, 1895),
      W. Granville Smith ("Scribner's Magazine," Christmas, 1894), W. L. Taylor,
      Abby E. Underwood, R. Wills Irving, C. H. Woodbury, Charles Hubbard
      Wright, and William M. Paxton. The last named has been chiefly associated
      with the "Boston Sunday Herald," and for that journal he has produced
      several posters of distinction.

      My review of the artistic poster movement in America has been of necessity
      brief, and cannot, therefore, be free from sins of omission. In writing
      it, I have, where my own knowledge has seemed to me insufficient, made use
      of the descriptive catalogue of the collection of American posters
      published last May by Mr. Charles Knowles Bolton, of Brookline,
      Massachusetts. From the useful bibliography printed at the end of this
      pamphlet, it would seem that the movement has been watched from the first
      by the American press with keen interest. So far back as the year 1892, we
      find Mr. Brander Matthews discussing the pictorial poster in the "Century"
      magazine. In the

      present year the subject has been dealt with by writers in such important
      newspapers as the "New York Tribune" and the "Boston Herald," to say
      nothing of such journals as "Scribner's Magazine," the "Critic," the "Art
      Interchange," and the "Art Amateur." Quite recently the English public
      have had opportunities of seeing the best work by French and native
      artists. It is to be hoped that at the next poster exhibition they will be
      afforded a chance of seeing what excellent work American designers are
      doing in this very practical branch of applied art.

      A poster by Mr. E. A. Abbey, illustrated on page 315, arrived too late for
      consideration in its proper place. It is entirely worthy the great
      reputation of the artist who has so kindly permitted us to reproduce it
      here. The figure is in red scale armour, bearing a shield with a red
      cross.

      CHAPTER X.&mdash;IN COUNTRIES NOT ALREADY DISCUSSED
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>hat the picture
      poster was an incident of the ancient civilizations of China and Japan;
      goes without saying. The scope, however, of this book does not embrace the
      Far East; the illustrated placard in the Orient would, indeed, be a
      subject in itself. In the matter of applied art it is difficult to
      conceive anything which the Chinese and the Japanese have not attempted.
      They seem, from the earliest days, to have been consumed with a passion
      for decoration; nothing which by any chance admitted of ornament was left
      undecorated. It behoves the societies which are formed for the purpose of
      illustrating the artistic antiquities of these wonderful countries to
      concern themselves with the dawn and history of the pictorial poster in
      the East. Certain it is that the illustrated advertisement abounded, as it
      abounds today, in the cities of both the nations now being discussed. It
      is, indeed, found in the less advanced civilization of Burma, and of the
      various principalities which form our Indian Empire. To pass from Asia to
      Spain is to travel a long way. In Spain, at the present moment, the
      illustrated placard is receiving no small attention at the hands of
      artists who, however discouraged and ill-paid, are determined to do all
      that in them lies to raise the country which produced Murillo to the
      position she once held among art-producing nations. A recent writer in the
      "Sketch" grows enthusiastic over the Spanish <i>affiche</i>. "Spanish
      posters," he tells us, "are a delight. Well drawn, vividly but truly
      coloured, and perfectly printed, they shine down from walls and hoardings,
      attracting all passers-by. They depict the glories of coming fairs and
      bull-fights, and are couched in terms calculated to draw money from a
      stone. The announcement that a famous matador will kill, or assist to
      kill, <i>Seis Escogidos Toros</i>, throws the Spanish reader into a state
      of frenzy. Not infrequently some incident is depicted with frank realism.
      A bull standing over a dead horse gives an opportunity to the artist to
      draw the unfortunate horse disembowelled and lying on blood-stained sand,
      while the bull's hide shows the marks of the lance-thrusts, and his horns
      are likewise stained with blood. Colour-printing is so good in these
      regions of perpetual sunlight that nearly every detail of a matador's
      costume can be given. The poster artists are splendid when they depict

      movement; they are satisfactory in their purely decorative work, but
      figures in repose are apt to become 'woodeny.' In point of colour, Spain
      beats France; and as France is so much in advance of England, it scarcely
      needs a Euclid to demonstrate that English posters cannot be compared to
      those of Spain. The latter exhibit at times an admirable sense of distance
      and proportion, which serves to show that their designers learnt to draw
      before they began to paint." The four examples reproduced here will serve
      to indicate the type of Spanish poster most frequently met with. Whether
      Spain, in the matter of the pictorial placard, is in advance of France or
      not, is a question of taste. However brilliant the colour of the Spanish
      <i>affiche</i>, the design seems to me to lack boldness. Take, for
      example, the "Gran Feria de Cordoba, 1895;" in this case the whole thing
      appears to be a series of elaborate details rather than a bold and
      impressive design. The poster in Spain, however, is rapidly becoming of
      interest, dealing as it does with fascinating and essentially picturesque
      subjects. It is difficult to obtain exact information concerning the
      artists who design posters in Spain; the examples which I reproduce here,
      I cannot attribute to anybody with any degree of certainty.

      The Teutonic temperament is in no sense akin to the Spanish, and the
      pictorial posters of Germany are utterly unlike those of Spain. For the
      most part the Germans have, in the past, been addicted to elaborate and
      often admirably-executed lithographs, such, for instance, as that done by
      Ernest Klint for the Musical and Theatrical Exhibition held at Vienna in
      1892. A new movement is, it appears, making itself conspicuous just now.
      The younger generation of German designers seem to be as anxious to
      experiment in the making of posters as those of France and England. Joseph
      Sattler, a designer of considerable originality and great dexterity, who
      has studied Albrecht Dürer with great advantage to his own work, has
      designed a very curious little window bill to advertise "Pan." It is
      reproduced here, and its strange individuality, its ingenuity, will not
      fail to make an impression upon those who look at it closely. The
      lettering is devised in an extraordinary way, and Sattler may be
      congratulated on the results of an interesting experiment. Very different
      to the work of Sattler is that of Franz Stuck. This represents a classical
      head in mosaic, and advertises an exhibition of the Munich Secessionists,
      a body of experimental painters and designers of rapidly-growing
      importance. The tendency of the illustrated poster in Austria is much the
      same as it is in Germany. Some admirable bills have been designed in
      Italy. Of its particular kind, I have seen few things better than a large
      and

      sombre poster to advertise Verdi's "Otello." At the same time, the Italian
      posters are not of a very distinctive type, nor does Italian taste
      concerning them appear to be very fastidious. The crude, enormous, and
      vulgar advertisements for Buffalo Bill's exhibition created quite a
      sensation in Rome when that redoubtable personage deigned to visit the
      most august of European capitals. The modern Romans forgot their Michael
      Angelo in the ecstasy induced by the latest enormity of the American
      colour printer. It may be noted that some of the posters done for the
      Italian railway companies are bright and gay as an Italian summer itself.
      The pictorial poster would not seem to have taken a great hold on Russia,
      nor, judging from a comparatively recent visit, has it made much headway
      in Scandinavia. In Holland, the present artistic vitality and enterprise
      of which are at once so astonishing and gratifying, one meets with very
      few posters of conspicuous merit. In Belgium, on the other hand, there are
      signs that the poster movement has affected not a few artists of
      distinction. The placard by Evenepoel, designed to advertise a publication
      in connexion with the Antwerp Exhibition, is excellent in colour and
      pattern and most decidedly original, owing very little to any foreign
      examples. Duyck's "Cortège des Fleurs (Ville de Bruxelles)" is decorative
      and pleasing. This artist has also designed another placard to advertise
      Spa (Ferme de Frahinfaz). To Delville we owe a curious little placard, in
      the Symbolist manner, which advertised "Pour l'art, Ier exposition à
      Bruxelles;" the advertisement for the second exhibition was the work of
      Ottevaere. A fantastic and rather picturesque poster was done to announce
      one of the annual exhibitions of "La Libre Esthetique." It represents a
      strange-looking human being standing among flowers, under a lurid sky, and
      holding in his hands a decorative scroll, upon which the legend is
      inscribed. Amongst other interesting Belgian placards are the "Velodrome
      Bruxellois" by G. Gaudy, the "Paul Hankar" by A. Crespin, and a poster in
      monochrome in imitation of a bas-relief bearing the legend "La plus noble
      force sociale est le Droit." All of these are reproduced here. It may be
      noted in conclusion that most of the Belgian posters show strong signs of
      French influence.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI.&mdash;THE PRICE OF THE PICTORIAL POSTER; AND CONCLUDING NOTE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t is obviously
      impossible to state accurately the price of the artistic poster, insomuch
      as fluctuations take place almost daily, and, moreover, the numerous
      dealers vary in their quotations in an extraordinary degree. Under these
      circumstances, the present chapter is written as a matter of current
      record, rather than with the idea that it will be of any permanent value
      for purposes of reference. It may be stated at the outset, that in dealing
      with the value of the poster, rarity has in the first place to be taken
      into consideration; and thus it happens that, while delightfully artistic
      designs are comparatively inexpensive, posters which are quite
      unattractive from the point of view of art are often very costly. The
      prices which follow are for the most part taken from the catalogues of M.
      Edmond Sagot of Paris, and Mr. Bella of London, the latter of whom, by the
      organization of exhibitions and in other ways, has rendered material
      assistance to English collectors. In fact, to some extent, he has called
      the English collector into existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an example of the price of the poster of which the interest is
      archaeological rather than artistic, one may instance a placard, dated the
      20th of February, 1649, which deals with the opening and closing of the
      gates of Paris. Its only claim to be considered pictorial consists in the
      fact that it is ornamented with a woodcut representing the arms of the
      city. Many similar productions were executed in relation to London and to
      other English towns. The price asked for it three or four years ago was
      thirty francs. Interesting from another point of view are the illustrated
      posters which have heralded new books, or new editions of books, by great
      writers. Three of these, relating to the works of Balzac, and including
      one with woodcuts by Meissonier and Tony johannot, are valued at twelve
      francs.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is time, however, to pass from pictorial posters, which are interesting
      on account of age or literary association, to those which derive their
      value from their qualities as works of art. In this class some of the
      highest prices are obtained by the French artists who, for the most part,
      were the contemporaries, or immediate successors, of Gavarni. The best
      posters of this master are extremely difficult to procure, and examples in
      a fine state realize large sums.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the "Oeuvres Choisis" bill, together with that designed to advertise
      an illustrated edition of Balzac's "Philosophie de la Vie Conjugale,"
      something over a hundred francs is asked, while less important works can
      be obtained for five-and-twenty or thirty francs. It goes without saying
      that the smallest tear or other injury, however neatly and skilfully
      repaired, heavily discounts the value of works by Gavarni and the men of
      his time; but even slightly damaged examples are eagerly sought for, as it
      is almost impossible to obtain perfect ones. Of the productions of Edouard
      de Beaumont, two of the rarest are the "Nains Célèbres," already
      mentioned, and the "Diable Amoureux." For an exceptionally fine proof of
      the former, as much as a hundred francs has been asked, while the latter,
      which is very rare, commands about sixty francs. Sums scarcely less
      formidable are given for the better posters of Grandville, and fifty
      francs for a good Tony Johannot is not by any means an exceptional price,
      although unimportant specimens of his work may be picked up in Paris for a
      few sous. The excursions of Gustave Doré into the art of the poster were
      very few. His most important work was perhaps the "Légende du Juif
      Errant," a fine proof of which realizes sixty francs or more. Posters by
      Vivant Beaucé, Castelli, Cham, Victor Coindre, Charles Devrits, H. Emy, A.
      Farcy, and others of the same period, for the most part command sums
      comparatively small; the best productions of Bertall, Calame, Monnier, and
      C. Nanteuil, on the other hand, are only a little less expensive than
      those of Gavarni and the more distinguished designers of his time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of posters by designers still living, those of Chéret have been most
      assiduously collected. It is probable that a complete set of his works
      does not exist; even one which is fairly representative, and includes some
      of his earlier and rarer <i>affiches</i>, is extremely valuable. In the
      Sagot catalogue of 1891, over five hundred and fifty posters by Chéret are
      described, and of these no less than eighty are priced at twenty francs or
      more. Since the publication of the catalogue, their value has steadily
      increased, and it is uncertain if many of them can now be procured at all.
      The collector of modest means need not, however, regret that the older and
      rarer examples of Chéret are beyond his reach, for the artist's more
      recent posters are the best that he has accomplished. For a comparatively
      small outlay, one may secure the flower of Chéret's work. Amongst the most
      valuable of his posters are two, of very large size, designed to advertise
      some Arabs who appeared with the Paris Hippodrome when it visited London
      in 1887. The price asked for them is over two pounds. They seem to have
      escaped the attention of French collectors from the fact that they were
      posted exclusively in London. The set of four

      Loie Fuller bills, in all of which the design is the same but the
      colouring different, is worth between thirty and forty shillings. These
      designs are among the most daring and characteristic specimens of Chéret's
      amazing colour, and as they only measure forty-nine by thirty-three
      inches, they are of manageable size, and should find their way into the
      portfolio of every collector. The set of unlettered decorative panels
      which were described in an earlier part of the book, is at present sold by
      all dealers for five pounds. It goes without saying that proofs before
      letters, or prints on special paper, of the posters of Chéret, or of
      nearly any other artist, are much more valuable than ordinary copies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of, the posters of other living French artists may still be procured
      for a few shillings, but it is extremely improbable that such a state of
      things will long continue to be the case. Already examples by men of the
      modern school, such as Toulouse-Lautrec, Anquetin, Bonnard, Steinlen, and
      Ibels, are in great demand, and collectors should use the present
      opportunity to procure a series of these curiously interesting designs
      before the prices rise. Even now, Lautrec's first attempt, "Le Pendu," has
      become <i>rarissime</i>, and is valued at something over a sovereign. What
      has happened in this case will doubtless happen in the case of "La Reine
      de Joie,"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jane Avril," and Lautrec's other posters. The designs of Grasset are
      rapidly taking their place by the side of those of Chéret in the
      estimation of collectors, with the result that several of them command
      large prices. Thus the "Librairie Romantique," which was offered in 1891
      for three francs, was priced by the same dealer in November, 1894, at
      twenty. What is going on in the case of Chéret, Grasset, and Lautrec, is
      going on, though it may be somewhat less rapidly, in the case of those
      other artists who have assisted to make the French <i>affiche</i> the
      charming and artistic thing it is.
    </p>
    <p>
      The posters of those artists who were the pioneers of the artistic poster
      movement in England are extremely rare. They worked in the days before the
      English collector existed, and any copies of their designs not actually
      posted, probably fell into the hands of the waste-paper dealer. I have
      been unable to trace any copies of the advertisement done by Fred Walker
      for "The Woman in White," but the original design has been recently
      exhibited in London, and the price put upon it by its owners is seventy
      guineas. Copies of Mr. Walter Crane's "Hippodrome" bill are extremely
      rare, as are those designed by Professor Herkomer for the "Magazine of
      Art," "Black and White," and the exhibition of his own works. Turning to
      the younger men, it is interesting to note that Mr. Dudley Hardy's "Yellow
      Girl" sells in Paris for twenty francs, the large "Gaiety Girl" for half
      as much, and the smaller bills for the same play for five francs. The
      first poster which this artist did for "St. Paul's" is very difficult to
      meet with; it will doubtless be among the most valuable of Mr. Hardy's
      designs. Mr. Beardsley's "Avenue" poster is quoted neither by Mr. Bella
      nor M. Sagot, and it may therefore be concluded that it is almost
      impossible to obtain it. The other posters of this designer are steadily
      increasing in value, and are eagerly sought for by collectors on both
      sides of the Channel. Mr. Greiffenhagen's "Pall Mall" poster, which has
      met with much success abroad, is worth about half a sovereign. The dainty
      little bill which Mr. Wilson Steer did for the exhibition of his paintings
      at the Goupil Gallery fetches about the same amount, and is rapidly
      becoming scarce. It is pleasant to think that the early efforts of English
      artists are welcomed by French collectors as enthusiastically as the
      masterpieces of French artists by collectors in England.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poster is obviously difficult to collect, because of its size. Not all
      of us are proprietors of such an immensity as the Chicago Exhibition. Most
      of us, on the other hand, could paper a room with posters of Lautrec
      alone. Everybody, however, can put the smaller bills into a portfolio,
      while the larger ones may be mounted as ordinary school maps. The
      collecting of pictorial posters needs nothing more than a little heroism.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the foregoing chapters, I have attempted to outline the history of art
      as applied to the poster, and to give an account of the pictorial placard
      in the present state of its development. The number of names, eminent in
      the history of various modern arts and crafts, who have applied themselves
      to the production of the pictorial poster seems to me to justify the
      publication of this book. The fact that men so highly endowed as Chéret
      and Lautrec deliberately choose to appeal to the public chiefly by means
      of the <i>affiche</i>, well knowing that their gallery is the common
      hoarding, places the illustrated poster outside the bounds of ridicule. A
      modern art critic of high repute and of enormous energy has assured us
      that, in these days, to neglect the poster is mere folly on the part of
      those who care for the application of taste and skill to the objects of
      everyday life. We are apt to talk of artistic periods; periods when the
      most ordinary objects had an aesthetic character of their own. It seems to
      me to be full of promise for the future that the hoarding should be among
      the first necessities of modern civilization to be rendered charming by
      the skill and imagination of the artist. Art is generally supposed to be
      inimical to commerce, and commerce inimical to art, yet here we have the
      two combining to the advantage of both, and succeeding in making the
      beautiful an incident of the necessary.
